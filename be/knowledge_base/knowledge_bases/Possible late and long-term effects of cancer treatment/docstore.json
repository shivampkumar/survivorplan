This assessment can be done by the oncologist or \nPCP. Shared , coordinated care between the oncology , primary care , and \nsubspecialty care  provider s is encouraged.  Depending on the cancer type \nand stage of disease, transition of care to primary care may be done when \ndeemed clinically appropriate, with referral back to oncologic care as \nneeded. The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be \naddressed at every visit.  \nSome tools that screen for long -term and late physical and psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment in survivors  have been validated.171-176 \nIn addition, the NCCN Survivorship Panel  created a sample screening \ninstrument  that is guideline -specific and can be self-administered or \nadministered by an interviewer . This assessment tool was developed \nspecifically for use in co mbination with the NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship to help providers deliver necessary and comprehensive \nsurvivorship care. Although this instrument has not yet been piloted or \nvalidated, t he answers can be used to guide  providers to  topics within the \nguidelines that require  more in -depth assessment  via validated tools \nand/or clinical evaluation.  \nIn addition  to screening by history and physical examination , care \nproviders should assess the following  at regular intervals:  \n1. Current disease status  \n2. Functional/p erformance status  \n3. Medication use ( including over -the-counter medications and \nsupplements ) \n4. Comorbidities  \n5. Prior cancer treatment history and modalities used  \n6. Family history  7. Psychosocial factors  \n8. Weight and health behaviors that can modify cancer and \ncomorbidity risk (including cigarette/tobacco, alcohol use)  \n9. Disease -specific recommendations for surveillance/follow -up (see \nNCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site , at \nwww.NCCN.org )  \n \nThis information can also inform about the patient\u2019s risk for specific late or \nlong-term effects, including risks for subsequent primary cancers and \ncomorbidities.

In general, those who underwent more intensive t herapy are \nat higher risk for multiple late and/or long -term effects. Survivors \nundergoing certain treatments, such as mantle field radiation or certain \nsystemic therapies, may be at increased risk for subsequent malignancies. \nThose survivors who continue to smoke are at increased risk for smoking -\nrelated comorbidities and subsequent primary cancers.  \nReassessment  \nSurvivors should be followed and reassessed at regular intervals, \ndepending on the nature and severity of late and long -term effects being \ntreated . At each time point, assessment of disease status and ongoing \neffects of cancer and its treatment should be addressed. In addition, \nsurvivors should be periodically rescreened for the development of new \nlate and long -term effects of cancer and its treatme nt. The outcomes of \nany interventions for ongoing effects of cancer and its treatment should be \nevaluated regularly based on best practices and available resources. \nOutcome assessment may include survivor satisfaction with the \neffectiveness of the interven tion in reducing symptom burden, adequate \npain control, receipt of recommended immunizations and preventive care,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "987b3ea6-f103-4b2a-8016-9271b341e5f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "987b3ea6-f103-4b2a-8016-9271b341e5f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec906fa9-a494-43fa-9d06-54c832685cb4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "ee702808e798145a9f41b1c51b40f3b047ded78c664f534e494bfeb7c702d177"}, "3": {"node_id": "2da2e711-7b59-4e77-bb01-5ec7ce251e74", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "6e78c224d33b993276d1e1880ecc01db10b5105f384e6518c4e222acb44a8d3e"}}, "hash": "2aa3949d3af6d123530cf9382d77ff52a4b237ff1b6e7849be03b283b9370449", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-4 Cancer Survivors  \nThe NIH adapted the definition of a cancer survivor from the National \nCoalition for Cancer Survivor and states : \u201cAn individual is considered a \ncancer survivor from the time of diagno sis, through the balance of their \nlife. There are many types of survivors, including those living with cancer \nand those fr ee of cancer. This term is meant to capture a population of \nthose with a history of cancer rather than to provide a label that ma y or \nmay not resonate with individuals .\u201d16  \nThe Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment  \nFor some survivors, the consequences of cancer are minimal; these \npatients can return to a normal life after the completion of treatment. In \nfact, most cancer survivors rep ort being in good general health and \nexperience good to excellent quality of life.17,18 Also, a survey of 659 \nsurvivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers  found that a majority \ndo not suffer from psychologic morbidity or have a large number of unmet \nsupportive care need s.19,20 Other studies have similarly found that most \nsurvivors enjoy a high quality of life without a large number of cancer -\nrelated symptoms.21,22 \nHowever, many survivors do experience physical and/or psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment.23-25 Some sequelae become evident \nduring anticancer treatment (long -term effects), whereas others may not \nmanifest for months or years after active therapy (late effects).  The \nproblems can range from mild to severe,  debilitating, or even life -\nthreatening. Some problems are temporary or improve with time, whereas \nother problems are progressive or permanent. This topic has been well \nreviewed.18,26 \nA literature review suggests that at least 50% of survivors experience \nsome late effect s of cancer treatment.26 The most common problems in \ncancer survivors are depression , pain, and fat igue.27 The exact prevalence of various effects of cancer and its treatment are hard to quantify, because \nfew studies have addressed these issues in a longitudinal fashion, \ncomparing patients with and without a histo ry of cancer to differentiate \nbetween the effects of cancer and the effects of aging.18 In general, the \nprevalence of late effects in cancer survivo rs is believed to have increased \nover time, likely because anticancer interventions have become more \ncomplex and intense with combinations of surgery, radiation, \nchemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted biologics.28 \nPhysical Effects  \nPhysical effects of cancer and its treatment in cancer survivors include \npain, muscu loskeletal issues, fatigue, lack of stamina, urinary and bowel \nproblems , lymphedema , premature menopause, cognitive deficits, \ndiabetes, and sexual dysfunction.18,29 -32 The effects of cancer treatment on \nthe heart and bone

other unwanted effects of \ntreatment and cancer can occur after treatment. \nA goal of survivorship care is to lower your \nchance of having these late effects. If detected \nearly, treatment for a late effect may reduce its \nimpact on your life.\nCancer surveillance\nCancer that was thought to be cured can \nreappear on tests. The return of cancer is \ncalled a recurrence or relapse. Survivorship \ncare includes routine checking for a recurrence. \nThis is called surveillance. Surveillance often \nincludes updating your health history and a \nphysical exam. Some survivors get blood tests \nor imaging like x-rays or scans.\nScreening for cancer\nCancer screening is routine testing of cancer \nor pre-cancer conditions. The aim is to detect \ncancer at an early stage when treatment works \nbest. There is screening for prostate, breast, \ncervical, skin, lung, and colorectal cancers. \nScreening is started when there is an average \nor high risk of cancer. Ask your health care \nprovider what screening, if any, you need.\nSurvivors have a higher risk of a new (second) \ncancer. Ask your health care provider about \nyour chance of getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some causes of a first cancer may be \nrelated to getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some cancer treatments may increase \ncancer risk. Such treatments include \nradiation therapy, certain chemotherapies, \nand certain targeted therapies. \u0086Excess radiation from a lifetime of \ncomputed tomography (CT) scans slightly \nincreases cancer risk. Ask your provider if \nthese scans are needed and for how long.\nSome survivors are at risk of hereditary \ncancers. Hereditary cancer is caused by \nabnormal genes that are passed down from \nparents to children. Cancers that can be \nhereditary include breast, ovarian, colorectal, \nand prostate cancer.\nAt health visits, update your health care \nproviders on any new cancers among your \nblood relatives. Your provider may suggest \ngetting genetic testing. A blood sample is \nneeded. You may talk with a genetic counselor \nto discuss your family\u2019s cancer history.\nLate effects\nMany effects of treatment quickly resolve \nafter treatment ends. An example is nausea \nand vomiting. Long-term effects start during \ntreatment and persist after treatment is done. \nLess often, effects start long after treatment \nhas ended. During health visits, your health \ncare providers will assess for such late effects. \nThey will provide treatment for late or long-term \neffects as needed.\nCoordinated care\nCancer survivors often receive care from \nmultiple providers.

In addition, lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of \nsubsequent primary cancers (eg, smoking cessation, physical activity, \nweight loss) should be encouraged.64 Finally, referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates, such as those with a cancer diagnosis at a young age or with \nmultiple primary cancers , to identify those with a potential increased risk  \nfor subsequent malignancies.65 Family cancer history should be \nperiodically updated to reassess hereditary risk, because it should not be \nassumed that all cancer survivors were assessed at diagnosis. Gen etic \ntesting guidelines and knowledge about hereditary cancer risk evolve over \ntime, and new family diagnoses may occur making periodic assessment \nimportant . Genetic risk assessment is appropriate for all survivors  of \nbreast cancer , epithelial ovarian cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, \npancreatic cancer, and colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed at age \n50 years or younger. Many other survivors of rare cancers, cancers \ndiagnosed at young ages, multiple primary cancers, or those  with one or \nmore relatives with the same or related cancers are also candidates for \nrisk assessment per guidelines from NCCN and other expert groups. Genetic counseling and testing is recommended for appropriate survivors \nbased on results of the risk asse ssment.

In addition, research focused \non patterns and quality of survivorship care  is lacking. A study of NIH \nsurvivorship grants in fiscal year 2016 showed a need for research \nincluding more diverse cancer types, older and longer -term survivors, and \nmore ethnoculturally diverse populations of survivors.181 \nIn June 2012, the ACS , CDC, LIVE STRONG  Foundation , and NCI held a \njoint meeting and created an action plan to facilitate the translation of \nsurvivorship research into survivorship care.182 The plan is driven by \ncollaboration between researchers, survivors, clinicians, and public health \nprofessionals; the use of technology, such as EHRs; analysis of \ninformation from the vie wpoints of multiple stakeholders; and the \nintegration and synthesis of knowledge using systematic reviews and \nmeta -analyses.  Recommendations for Preventive Health  \nAnalysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  \n(BRFSS)  indicates that a  large proportion of cancer survivors have \nsignificant comorbidities, smoke, are obese, and/or do not engage in \nphysical activity.183 Analysis of data from oth er studies, including the \nNational Health Interview Survey , showed similar results.184-187 Separate \nsurveys by the ACS and the CDC  found that 9.3% and 17% of survivors \nsmoke, respectively.186,188 In addition, many survivors forego \nrecommended cancer screenings (ie, co lorectal and cervical screening) \nand follow -up surveillance189-191 or demand more intense surveillance than \nevidence sup ports.84 \nHealthy Lifestyles  \nHealthy lifestyle habits, such as enga ging in routine physical activity, \nmaintaining a healthy diet and weight, and avoiding cigarette/ tobacco use, \nhave been associated with improved health outcomes and quality of life. \nFor some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been associated with a reduced \nrisk of recurrence and death .192-199 In fact, the maintenance of a healthy \nlifestyle is associated with a decrease in premature death in cancer \nsurvivors.200 Therefore,  survivors should be encouraged to achieve and \nmaintain a healthy lifestyle , including  attention to weight management, \nphysical  activity, metabolic health, and dietary habits.  Setting incremental \ngoals for diet, physical activity, and weight management  should be \nadvised . Survivors should be counseled to limit alcohol intake and avoid or \nstop using cigarette/ tobacco products, with emphasis on tobacco \ncessation if the survivor is  a current smoker or user of smokeless tobacco \n(see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).201 Clinicians should also advise survivors to practice sun \nsafety habits  as appropriate, such as using a broad -spectrum sunscreen, \navoiding peak sun hours, and using physical barriers.

Identificati on and management of fatigue remain an \nunmet need for many cancer survivors.  \nThe specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of cancer -\nrelated fatigue are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include pro -\ninflammatory cytokines, hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis \ndysregulation, circadian rhythm desynchronization, skeletal muscle \nwasting, and genetic dysregulation.681-686 Several studies have focused on \nthe cause of fatigue, especially in cancer survivors with no evidence of \nactive disease, and have su ggested that persistent immune system \nactivation and chronic inflammatory processes may be involved.666,687 -689 \nEvidence supporting these mechanisms is limited.  \nScreening for Fatigue  \nAll survivors should be screened for fatigue to ensure that those with \nmoderate to severe fatigue are identified and treated promptly and \neffectively. Because fatigue is a subjective experience, clinicians must rely \non patients\u2019 descriptions of their fatigue level. The panel recommends the \nuse of a severity scale, with survivors being asked, \u201cHow would you rate \nyour fatigue on a scale of 0 t o 10 over the past 7 days?\u201d Alternatively, screening can be performed with patients asked to rate their fatigue as \nnone, mild, moderate, or severe. Scores of 0 to 3 or none to mild fatigue \nrequire no further assessment or interventions; these patients shou ld be \nrescreened at regular intervals. Patients with scores of 4 or greater or \nindicating moderate or severe fatigue should be evaluated further. Studies \nin patients with cancer have revealed a marked decrease in physical \nfunctioning at a reported fatigue level of 7 or higher on the 0 to 10 \nscale.690,691 \nEvaluation for Moderate to Severe Fatigue  \nWhen fatigue is rated as moderate to severe, with a score of 4 to 10, a \nmore focused history and physical examination should be conducted. A \nthorough history is warranted, because the recommended workup for \nfatigue differs according to the timing of fatigue onset in relation to the \ncompletion of active therapy and the presence of predisposing factors and \nother symptoms. Fatigue has a variable natural history, with some patients \ncomplain ing of only mild levels of fatigue even during active therapy and \nothers experiencing severe fatigue for years after treatment completion.  \nIn general, mild to moderate levels of fatigue that persist for 6 to 12 \nmonths after the completion of therapy do not warrant an extensive \nworkup, unless other symptoms are present. Conversely, when moderate \nto severe fatigue begins after or worsens during  this period, or when other \nsymptoms are present, such as pain, pulmonary complaints, or \nunintentional weight loss, a more extensive workup is warranted to screen \nfor the presence of metastatic disease or other comorbidities. Refer ral to a \npulmonologist should be made for pulmonary complaints . \nRegardless of fatigue onset, it is always relevant to screen for common \ncontributing factors such as emotional distress, sleep disturbance, pain, \nand the use of prescriptions or over -the-counter medications or \nsupplem ents.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

long breaks from or \neven leave their jobs during treatment, and returning to work after cancer \ntreatment can be critical to restoring normalcy to the lives of survivors. \nHowever, survivors may be left with di sabilities or late/long -term effects \nthat decrease their employment prospects or ability to perform at their \nprevious levels. Several studies have shown that unemployment rates for \nsurvivors are higher than for the general population.87-90 Furthermore, \nthose survivors who do return to work often encounter difficulties, such as \nphysical or c ognitive limitations, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and \nperceived or real discrimination.87,91,92 \nSeveral studies  have addressed factors that predict a delayed return to \nwork.93-99 For example, a French p opulation -based study revealed that \nclinical factors, such as severity of the cancer, receipt of chemotherapy , or \nthe experience of adverse effec ts, were associated with a delay in return \nto work.97 In addition, a systematic review of cohort studies found that \nsurvivors who were o lder, had a lower educa tion level, or had a  lower \nincome  were less likely to return to work.98 Another systematic review \nidentified factors related to the person ( eg, symptoms, coping, motivation), \nenvironmental supports ( eg, family, workplace), and occupation ( eg, type \nof work, job flexibility)  that impacted successful return to work after cancer \ntreatment.100 \nSome interventions to enhance return -to-work in cancer survivors have \nbeen studied (eg, psycho -education , physical training, vocational \ncounseling ), although additional research in this area is greatly needed .101-\n104 Multidisciplinary interventions that combine vocational counseling with \nother elements (eg,  patient education, patient counseling, behavioral \ntraining , physical exercises ) may increase rates of  return -to-work \ncompared to usual care.  Financial Burden  \nThe LIVESTRONG 2012  Survey found that approximately 33% of working -\nage survivors went into debt and 3% had filed for bankruptcy.105 The ACS  \nStudy of Cancer Survivors II  found that 20% of survivors reported unmet \nfinancial needs.24 A study in Washington state found that patients with \ncancer have a 2.6 -fold increase d risk of bankruptcy.106 In another study, \n38% of patients with stage III colon cancer reported financial hardship  \nresulting from cancer treatment, defined as  accruing debt, selling or \nrefinancing  a home, borrow ing money from friends or family, or \nexperienc ing a \u226520% decline in annual income .107 Another study found \nthat, in addition to the average >$16,000 excess economic burden  that \npatients feel in th e early phases of cancer treatment, survivors (>1 year \nfrom diagnosis) have an average annual excess economic burden  that \nexceeds $4,000.108,109 Much of this excess burden was because of excess \nmedical expenditures. A more r ecent study found that the excess annual \nhealth  care expenditures of cancer survivors averaged about $4400, and \nthat the t otal mean annual direct health care expenditure for cancer \nsurvivors  increased by about $1000 in the period from 2009 to 2010 to the \nperiod from  2015  to 2016 .109 Other recent studies also found  that cancer \nsurvivors have greater out -of-pocket expenses and are more likely to \nexperience material hardship than those without a history of cancer.110,111 \nYounger cancer survivors seem to be particular ly vulnerable to the \nfinancial effects of cancer.111-113 \nClearly, with lost wages and increased expenses, the fin ancial burden on \nmany cancer survivors is great.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66cd667b-04f0-486d-b3e1-b77153a42de1": {"__data__": {"id_": "66cd667b-04f0-486d-b3e1-b77153a42de1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6319e5a-87c2-4494-97bb-97ca5c54338c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "cca2d62d3127ac8724bce985ade13608ef0754cc9cb5bc3ae0b2a5855d924bf5"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed3c01c6-d5cf-4d5c-853b-bd6947fd5d77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "46c4dbaa849464b59f6499910dc63370cef487ccee751f68584ec1efc37858d9"}}, "hash": "1a9868c0b69a558b4535951a22b7f6e026cd65a19eda370337976d35ab8a3ff6", "text": "Recent data suggest that patients \nbelonging to racial and ethnic minorities are more  likely to suffer financial \nhardship after cancer treatment.114,115 Furthermore, the financial burden \nassociated with cancer treatment and survivorship can lower health -\nrelated quality of life , increase  psychologic distress, and impact adherence \nto prescribed medications.116-119", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19a75b46-23ea-40f7-955d-da35fe52d809": {"__data__": {"id_": "19a75b46-23ea-40f7-955d-da35fe52d809", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d049de6b-4ecd-4fc2-b870-6d19ca2852bf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "0072600acd2155593bb9810fbccdaf3f023995a6d3a643802aa0dd3786250710"}}, "hash": "0072600acd2155593bb9810fbccdaf3f023995a6d3a643802aa0dd3786250710", "text": "Fatigue Review\nReview\n \u0086Cancer-related fatigue is a distressing, \nongoing tiredness that limits one\u2019s ability to \ndo day-to-day tasks.\n \u0086Many cancer survivors have fatigue as a \nresult of cancer or its treatment.\n \u0086Fatigue screening helps identify people \nwith fatigue and assess treatment results.\n \u0086Your health care provider will identify and \ntreat the causes of your fatigue.\n \u0086Learn about patterns of fatigue among \ncancer survivors.

Fatigue \nscreening helps identify people with fatigue and \nassess treatment results.\nFatigue ranges from mild to severe levels. Your \nprovider will perform an in-depth assessment \nif you have moderate or severe fatigue months \nafter initial treatment. An assessment is also \nneeded if fatigue starts or worsens after \ntreatment ends. \nYour provider will ask you questions. Be ready \nto describe when the fatigue started and \nwhether it\u2019s changed over time. Your provider \nwill also assess for causes of fatigue that can \nbe treated.

In a \nrandomized controlled trial of 152 fatigued patients with advanced cancer, \ntreatment of accompanying physical symptoms, including pain, nausea, \nvomiting, and shortness of breath, resulted  in a significantly higher impact \non general fatigue, activity, and motivation than usual care.692 \nPatient and Family Education and Counseling  \nEducation and counseling can be beneficial in helping patients cope with \nfatigue. Understanding typical patterns of fatigue during and after \ntreatment can help patients set reasonable expectations regarding \nimprovements in energy after the completion of can cer therapy and can \nhelp allay concerns that persistent fatigue after the completion of therapy \nis evidence of disease recurrence. Counseling can help patients develop \nstrategies for self -monitoring of fatigue and techniques such as energy conservation tha t may be helpful in the immediate post -treatment \nperiod.693 \nPhysical Activity  \nActivity en hancement is a category 1 recommendation for the \nmanagement of fatigue in survivors. Improving strength, energy, and \nfitness through regular exercise, even a moderate -intensity walking \nprogram, has been shown to facilitate the transition from patient to \nsurvivor, decrease anxiety and depression, improve body image, and \nincrease tolerance for physical activity. Therefore, survivors with moderate \nto severe fatigue should be encouraged to maintain adequate levels of \nphysical activity (category 1). Robust data support the efficacy of \nincreased physical activity for reducing fatigue in patients with cancer and \nsurvivors.204,210,215,217,219,560,694 -700 Multiple meta -analyses of randomized \ncontrolled trials have found that cancer survivors who participate in \nexercise interventions, either during or after treatment for cancer, \nexperience significant improvements in fatigue com pared with patients \nrandomized to the control group.204,700 -703 A randomized phase 3 trial that \nincluded 410 cancer survivors showed that a 4-week yoga therapy \nprogra m led to impro vements in fatigue and sleep quality and reductions in \ndaytime dysfunction .704 \nSurvivors at a higher risk of injury should be referred to a physical \ntherapist or exercise specialist (also see Healthy Lifestyles , above ). \nPsychosocial and Other Interventions  \nPsychosocial int erventions, such as CBT, MBSR, psycho -educational \ntherapy, and supportive expressive therapy, including support groups, \ncounseling, and journal writing (all category 1 recommendations), have \nalso been shown to reduce fatigue in cancer survivors, although d ata are \nnot entirely consistent.567,705 -710 Several meta -analyses have evaluated the \nrole of psychosocial interventions in reducing fatigue.700,705,709,711 For", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3353a62-b51b-45c6-89fc-ac43999b84e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3353a62-b51b-45c6-89fc-ac43999b84e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f479d367-0798-4924-98fb-1069a34520cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "8b974093688f052a23b9680ceae3898595c9c8e2a98956297e0909c80e129936"}}, "hash": "8b974093688f052a23b9680ceae3898595c9c8e2a98956297e0909c80e129936", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Distress \n\n\nSANXDE-B\u2022 Physical\n\u0017Recurrence of cancer\n\u0017Intensive treatment (eg, HCT, intensive care unit stay)\n\u0017Unrelieved chronic pain or physical dysfunction\n\u0017Advanced disease\n\u0017Younger age\n\u2022 Psychosocial\n\u0017Exposure to previous trauma (eg, combat, sexual assault, major loss)\n\u0017History of mental health issues prior to cancer\n\u0017Poor coping skills (eg, using avoidance)\n\u0017Lower income and/or less education\n\u0017Less social support\n\u2022 Significant change in life stressors including health, interpersonal, financial, and occupationalRISK FACTORS FOR PTSD", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "570fcd64-72d2-4e31-b43f-41c7e49fac9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "570fcd64-72d2-4e31-b43f-41c7e49fac9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1c10f821-e83b-4087-b881-ee1650428f61", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "856516a68dbe5bb60714ade588680a09954040f70bc78818ea7b7eb0aea72b4d"}}, "hash": "856516a68dbe5bb60714ade588680a09954040f70bc78818ea7b7eb0aea72b4d", "text": ".\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Exposure  \n(and body part affected,  \nwhere noted)Increased Subsequent \nPrimary Cancer RiskScreening and Early Detection \nRecommendations Comments\nRadiation Therapy, Including Total Body Irradiation (TBI)\u2013Continued\nMantle/Chest Breast cancer  \n(assigned female at birth)aBreast MRI and mammogram annually, \nstarting at age 30 or 8 years after radiation, \nwhichever occurs last, for exposure \u226510 \nGy and <30 years old.

Barriers to optimal pain \nmanagement in cancer survivor s include health care providers\u2019 lack of \ntraining, fear of side effects and addiction, and reimbursement issues.947 \nPain has two predominant mechanisms: nociceptive and  neuropathic.948,949 \nInjury to somatic and visceral structures and the resulting activation of \nnociceptors present in skin, viscera, muscles, and connective tissues \ncause nociceptive pain. Somatic nociceptive pain is often d escribed as \nsharp, throbbing, or pressure -like, and often occurs after surgical \nprocedures. Visceral nociceptive pain is often diffuse and described as \naching or cramping.  Neuropathic pain is caused by injury to the peripheral \nnervous system or CNS  and might be described as numbness or as \nburning, sharp,  tingling, prickling, electrical,  or shooting  pain. Neuropathic \npain often occurs as a side  effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or \nis caused by  surgical injury to the nerves.

Approximately 3 in 4 \ncases of lymphedema are diagnosed within 3 years of treatment; however, it can develop anytime in the life of the survivor. Depending on \nstage of diagnosis, lymphedema can be an acute or chronic condition. It can impact any area of the body (eg, arms, legs, face, trunk, groin).\n\u2022 Swelling on the same side as the cancer treatment is a universal symptom of lymphedema. Additional initial symptoms may include \nsensation of heaviness, fatigue, fullness or tightness in the skin, or pain. Symptoms including decreased range of motion or function and \nthickening of the skin may occur in later stages.a \n\u2022 Survivors who had surgery, radiation, or chemoradiation to the axillary, supraclavicular, cervical, or pelvic inguinal lymph node system are \nat risk for the development of lymphedema. Sentinel node biopsy also increases the risk of lymphedema, although it poses less risk than \ncomplete dissection. \n\u2022 BMI \u226530 kg/m2, localized infection, increased number of nodes removed, and higher initial extent of disease raise the risk of lymphedema \ndevelopment.\n\u2022 If possible, pretreatment limb measurement of both sides should be performed as a baseline for survivors with treatment-related or \nindividual risk factors, preferably by a trained lymphedema specialist.\n\u2022 Early detection/diagnosis and early referral are key for optimal lymphedema management because stages 0 and 1 are reversible, whereas \nstages 2 and 3 are less responsive to treatment. Therefore, survivors at risk for lymphedema should be regularly screened for lymphedema \nby symptom assessment, clinical exam, and, if available, bioimpedance spectroscopy. Patients should be educated about early symptoms \nand signs of lymphedema including fullness, tightness, heaviness, and pain.\n\u2022 Lymphedema may cause or exacerbate psychological distress (SANXDE-1) .\n\u2022 Survivors at risk for lymphedema and those with lymphedema are at a higher risk of localized infection in the affected area.

Read this chapter to learn \nhow to take care of your mental health.\nDistress is normal\nDistress is an unpleasant experience of a \nmental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. \nIt can affect the way you think, feel, or act. \nDistress is normal during cancer care, but it \nmay make it harder to cope with cancer. \nDistress ranges from mild to severe levels. \nMany survivors have a normal fear of a cancer \nrecurrence. Mild distress may reduce quality of \nlife. Severe distress can affect a person\u2019s self-\ncare, social life, mood, or faith. Survivors with \nsevere distress may not go to health visits or \nhave a healthy lifestyle.\nDistress can lead to or worsen mental \ndisorders. Mental disorders are health \nconditions just like heart disease is a health \ncondition. There are many types of mental \ndisorders. Each mental disorder is a group of \nsymptoms that are related to major problems \nwith emotion, thinking, or behavior. Anxiety \nand depressive disorders are common among \ncancer survivors.\n \u0086Symptoms of anxiety include severe \nfear or worry, panic attacks, and strong \nbehavioral impulses.\n \u0086Symptoms of depression include feeling \ndown or irritable and losing interest in \nthings that you used to like.Screening and assessment\nYour cancer or primary care provider may \nscreen for distress or mental disorders on a \nregular basis. Ongoing screening is important. \nMental health issues can start any time after a \ncancer diagnosis. Also, your provider may not \nknow you\u2019re struggling unless you very clearly \nsay so.\nDistress can occur at any point in time, but \nthere are times when distress is more likely. \nDistress is likely during routine health care \nvisits, when getting health tests, or when \nsymptoms occur. Mental health screening is \nvery important at these times.\nA mental health screening tool consists of a \nbrief scale or short survey. If you\u2019re struggling \nwith a mental health issue, your provider \nwill ask more questions. It\u2019s important to \nunderstand the type and cause of distress and \nto rule out other health conditions. You will be \nasked about a range of topics.\n \u0086Emotional symptoms like worry, sadness, \nand irritability\n \u0086Physical symptoms like trouble sleeping, \nlack of energy, heart pounding\n \u0086Cognitive symptoms like trouble \nconcentrating and mind going blank\n \u0086Loss of ability to do normal life activities\n \u0086Medical factors like illness, medication, \nand alcohol or drug abuse", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b533aaa-9723-4f0e-841d-40552d0e7a3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b533aaa-9723-4f0e-841d-40552d0e7a3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "452ff003-320c-4571-82b9-6c49b9f3c982", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "43317660a629a51538830b0e446b3052d9d6e831e35d2097a1e33ef4dc1e69b9"}}, "hash": "43317660a629a51538830b0e446b3052d9d6e831e35d2097a1e33ef4dc1e69b9", "text": ".\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Exposure  \n(and body part affected, \nwhere noted)Increased Subsequent Primary Cancer Risk Screening and Early Detection \nRecommendations Comments\nTransplant Conditioning Therapy (RT or chemotherapy) \nHematopoietic Cell \nTransplantation\u2022 May increase the risk for a variety of hematologic \nor solid tumor cancers, including skin cancer, \nmyelodysplatic syndrome/acute myeloid \nleukemia (MDS/AML), liver cancer, cervical \ncancer, or oral cancer\n\u2022 May increase the risk for lymphoproliferative \ndisorders\u2022 CBC if clinically indicated due to \nsigns or symptoms of disease\n\u2022 Adhere to age-appropriate cancer \nscreening recommendations\n\u2022 Consider annual skin exam and/or \ndermatology referral \u2022 Chronic GVHD may increase the risk of \ncertain subsequent malignancies1,2\n\u2022 Counsel on sun safety and regular use of \nsunscreen  \n(at least SPF 30)\n\u2022 Counsel on importance of regular dental \ncheckups\nSystemic Therapy\nAlkylating Agents, \nAnthracyclines, \nEpipodophyllotoxinsHematologic malignancies  \n(eg, AML)CBC if clinically indicated due to \nsigns or symptoms of disease\nAlkylating Agents Bladder cancer Urine cytology if clinically indicated \ndue to signs or symptoms of diseaseWhen given in combination with pelvic \nradiation, risk is increased\nTamoxifen Endometrial cancer Assess vaginal pain or bleeding \nannually; \nIf abnormal uterine bleeding, referral \nto gynecology for consideration of \ntransvaginal ultrasound and biopsyc Very little risk in premenopausal survivors; \nrisk is primarily in postmenopausal survivors \nwith a uterus.\nPARP Inhibitors\nLutetium-octreotideMDS; AML CBC if clinically indicated due to \nsigns or symptoms of diseaseMDS and AML are rare; usually after long-\nterm treatment3,4\n1 Gunduz M, Ozen M, Sahin U, et al.

Stage 0 lymphedema is the earliest \nstage when there are subtle or no symptoms. \nSwelling starts in stage 1 and gets worse in \nstages 2 and 3. \nLymphedema is common among cancer \nsurvivors. It may occur after surgery or radiation \nto lymph nodes near the armpit, collarbone, \nor groin. It may also occur after procedures \ncalled sentinel node biopsy and lymph node \ndissection. Assessment and referral\nIf you are at risk for lymphedema, your cancer \ndoctor will ask about symptoms at health \nvisits. Lymphedema can occur any time after \ncancer treatment but most often occurs within \n18 months. If symptoms are present, your \ndoctor will ask questions about:\n \u0086How often and severe is the swelling\n \u0086Pain or discomfort\n \u0086Loss of strength, range of motion, or \nmobility\n \u0086Ability to do things you usually do\nTo confirm that you have lymphedema, tests \nare needed to rule out a return or worsening of \ncancer. You then may be referred to a certified \nlymphedema therapist. This therapist may be a \nphysician, an occupational therapist, or physical \ntherapist.\nThe therapist may measure your limb. If not \nmeasured before treatment, the swollen limb \ncan be compared to the normal limb.

These skills include learning, \nreasoning, memory, problem solving, and \ndecision-making. Cognitive dysfunction is an \nimpairment of one or more thinking skills.\nMany cancer survivors report having some \ndegree of cognitive dysfunction. Common \nproblems occur with memory, attention, \nplanning, processing, and learning. Cognitive \ndysfunction may be caused by cancer and its \ntreatment. It may be more severe when cancer \nstarts in or spreads to the brain. \nCognitive dysfunction most commonly \noccurs after chemotherapy. When related to \nchemotherapy, it is often called \u201cchemobrain.\u201d \nThe causes of chemobrain are not well \nunderstood. Other cancer treatments that may \ncause cognitive dysfunction include endocrine \ntherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. \nCognitive dysfunction differs between cancer \nsurvivors. The type of problem varies. Problems \ncan be long-term or short lived. Most survivors \ndo not have severe problems but some do. \nWhen severe, cognitive dysfunction can impact \nquality of life and ability to work.Assessment\nAt this time, there isn\u2019t one good screening tool \nof cancer-related cognitive dysfunction. To get \nhelp, tell your health care provider about any \ncognitive problems you have. Ask family or \nfriends to share what they have observed. Your \nhealth care provider will ask questions about \nthe nature, onset, and course of the problem.\nYour provider will assess what is causing or \nadding to the cognitive dysfunction.

Your care provider will \nassess your level of distress and resources. \nIf you have a plan to do harm, your weapons \nwill be secured, you will be watched, and \nemergency services will be contacted. If you \nhave thoughts of death but no plans to hurt \nyourself, you will be referred for mental health \nservices. You must agree to call 911 or go the \nemergency department if you feel close to \ndoing harm.\nResources and referrals\nYour care provider can put you in touch with \nlocal resources. Based on your needs, you \nmay need help with practical problems, such \nas housing and food. You may benefit from \neducational and support groups. \nYour cancer or primary care provider may \nrefer you to a specialist. Specialists include \nchaplains, social workers, psychologists, \npsychiatrists, and advanced practice clinicians. \nChaplains can help you with religious or \nspiritual concerns.

Occupational \ntherapy strategies focus on improvement of cognitive fu nctioning and may \nbe most effective for individuals who note the impact of specific functional \nlimitations, such as word finding, comprehension, and task completion, on \nwork performance, quality of life, or role expectations.650 Psychotherapy is \nanother option.  \nPharmacologic Interventions for Cognitive Dysfunctio n \nIf nonpharmacologic interventions have been insufficient, consideration of \na trial of medications such as methylphenidate, modafinil, or donepezil is \nreasonable in select survivors or certain clinical scenarios , although data \ninforming the efficacy of th ese agents are lacking. Trials assessing the \neffects of the psychostimulant methylphenidate have reported mixed \nresults.651 For example, a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind \ntrial found that d -methylphenidate had no effect on neuropsychological test \nscores.652 In contrast, a randomized, double -blind, crossover trial of child \nsurvivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or brain tumors showed \nthat methylphenidate was more effective than placebo at improving \nattention, cognitive flexibi lity, and processing speed.653 \nResults of studies on modafinil, another psychostimulant, are more \nconsistent. A randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of \nmodafinil for fatigue and c ognitive function in breast cancer survivors \nfound significantly greater improvement in memory and attention among patients receiving modafinil than in the placebo group.654 Similarly, a \ndouble -blind, randomized, crossover trial also in breast cancer survivors \nfound that participants rec eiving modafinil performed significantly better on \ncognitive tests of attention and psychomotor speed.655 Benefits with \ntreatment were also noted among patients with primary brain tumors.656 \nDonepezil  is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat patients with \nAlzheimer\u2019s  disease.

Studies have reported elevated levels of \ncytokines or DNA damage as some of the possible mechanisms.622 \nStructural studies have supported the hypothesis that neurotoxicity \nresulting in damage to white matter of the brain may play an important role \nin cognitive deficits after chemotherapy treatment,583,586,599,623,624 and \nfunctional MRI studies show that changes in brain activity accompany \ncognitive complaints or cognitive deficits in survivors.624-626 In addition, \ninsomnia, fatigue, and depression, common in cancer survivors, may \nnegatively influence cognitive function, although several studies have \nfound that cognitive dysfunction does not correlate with mood.616,627,628 \nPsychosomati c effects can also contribute, as evidenced by a study of \npatients to be treated with chemotherapy that found that those who were \ninformed of the possible cognitive side effects were more likely to report \ncognitive dysfunction and perform worse on neuropsy chological testing \nthan uninformed patients.629 A better und erstanding of the mechanisms \nthat cause cancer -related cognitive impairment is essential for the \ndevelopment of treatments to improve cognitive function and quality of life \nin patients with cancer and survivors.582,630,631 \nIn October 2006, the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force \n(ICCTF)  was formed, comprising a multidisciplinary group of health \nprofessionals and health advocates. The mission of ICCTF is to advance \nunderstanding of the impact of cancer and cancer -related treatment on \ncognitive and behavioral functioning in patients with C NS and non -CNS \ncancers.632 The group published recommendations regarding \nneuropsychological testing, defining cognitive impairment /changes, \nneuroimaging, and future study design.631,633 \nThese NCCN Guidelines address cognitive function of survivors with non -\nCNS malignancies who did not have CNS -directed therapies.  Assessment and Evaluation for Cognitive Dysfunction  \nPatients who report cognitive impairment should be screened for \npotentially reversible factors that may contribute to cognitive impairment, \nincluding depression, pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Some  \nmedications can also contribute to cognitive impairment. Therefore, \ncurrent medications, including over -the-counter medications and \nsupplements, should be reviewed.  \nFor those who present with concomitant focal neurologic deficits and those \nwhose symptoms  evolve to include these findings, imaging is indicated to \nrule out structural abnormalities  (ie, brain or CNS disease). In addition, \nimaging in the absence of focal findings may be appropriate for patients \ndeemed to be at high risk for recurrence or metas tatic disease involving \nthe CNS.  \nUnfortunately, no effective brief screening tool for cancer -associated \ncognitive dysfunction in the asymptomatic cancer survivor currently exists. \nThe Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE634) and similar screening tools \nlack adequate sensitivity  to detect the subtle decline in cognitive \nperformance seen in most cancer survivors. Instead, the panel listed \nseveral questions that can help clarify the nature of the impairment, \nincluding inquiries about the ability to pay attention, find words, rememb er \nthings, think clearly, and perform functions. The time of onset of symptoms \nand the trajectory over time should also be assessed.  \nManagement of Cognitive Dysfunction  \nSurvivors benefit from validation of their symptom experience and should \nbe reassured t hat, in most survivors, cognitive dysfunction does not \nworsen over time. In fact, data from breast cancer survivors suggest that \nsymptoms may improve over time.585 The panel recommends the use of \nnonpharmacologic interventions whenever possible, with pharmacologic \ninterventions as a last line of therapy in survivors for whom other \ninterventions have been insufficient, as discussed in the following", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e432092-dc97-4005-b918-632baafcc3a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e432092-dc97-4005-b918-632baafcc3a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ebc0fb34-0f16-4c0d-93bd-3f0df0f3f022", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "90902eb8e1f20a5943e2f60a8ca615d0a626e589fc63895d4ce7e68d40376f12"}}, "hash": "90902eb8e1f20a5943e2f60a8ca615d0a626e589fc63895d4ce7e68d40376f12", "text": "\u201d1172 \nSleep Disorders  \nSleep disturbances include insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep \nresulting in daytime dysfunction), excessive sleepiness  (which can result \nfrom insufficient sleep opportunity, insomnia , or other sleep disorders), \nand sleep -related movement or breathing disorders.1173 Sleep \ndisturbances are common, affect ing 30% to 50% of patients with cancer \nand survivors, often in combination with pain, fatigue, anxiety, and/or \ndepression.1173 -1184 In fact, sleep disorders have been shown to be a r isk \nfactor for suicide.536 Improvements in sleep quality lead to improvements \nin fatigue, mood, and overall quality of life.717 Most clinicians, however, do \nnot know how best to evaluate and treat sleep disorders.1173 \nSleep disorders are common in patients with cancer as a result of multiple \nfactors, including disease - or treatment -related biologic changes in sleep \nand wake regulation, the stress of di agnosis and treatment, and side \neffects of therapy (eg, pain, fatigue).1185 In addition, evidence suggests \nthat changes in inflammat ory processes from cancer and its treatment play \na role in sleep disorders.

the incidence of  completed suicide among patients with \ncancer and survivors in the United States is about twice that of the general \npopulation.513-518 \nRisk factors for psychosocial distress in cancer survivors include \npersistent problems with physical health ;

They \ncan be used to optimize health and wellness for all survivors; however, they were created to assist health care professionals who work with survivors \nof adult-onset cancer in the post-treatment period, including those in both the oncology and primary care practices. \n\u2022 The panel recognizes that many of the post-treatment issues covered in these Guidelines are best addressed before cancer treatment begins so that \nmany problems can be prevented or minimized.\n\u2022 These guidelines are designed to provide a framework for the general survivorship care and management of potential long-term and/or late effects of \ncancer and its treatment that survivors may experience.\n\u2022 The NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship should be used as a supplement to the follow-up recommendations within the disease-specific guidelines. See \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site and NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care for recommendations regarding metastatic disease. \n\u2022 These guidelines, with the appropriate disease-specific guideline, provide a framework for the coordination of care between the survivor's health care \nproviders to ensure that needs are appropriately addressed.\n\u2022 The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be addressed at every visit. The panel recommends periodic screening assessments and \nappropriate follow-up care as clinically indicated. \n\u2022 Referral to other health care disciplines/providers or community resources may be used to address several indications or identified issues with one \nintervention (eg, rehabilitation for fatigue, depression, and pain).\n\u2022 The panel recommends stakeholders ensure the implementation of guideline-concordant survivorship care within their unique health \nsystems.1  Specifically, institutions are encouraged to determine how to systematically deliver the six key components of survivorship care \n(SURV-1).1-3 There are several models of care that frame the implementation of survivorship care according to provider type(s), clinic type(s), \npatient risk, and other factors.4-7 Engaging these models of care will facilitate implementation planning.7 Panel members recommend \ninstitutions provide the resources necessary to plan, deliver, and evaluate their survivorship care program(s).1-2\n\u2022 For survivorship issues related to younger populations, also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and the \nChildren's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers  \n(www.survivorshipguidelines.org).\n\u2022 For survivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune-mediated toxicities is warranted.

These guidelines are focused on options to \nmaintain and enhan ce wellness in cancer survivors who are receiving or \nhave completed active therapy, including  those receiving treatment for \nyears, those who may be in remission, and those who are cured. These \nguidelines are designed to provide a framework for the manageme nt of \nlong-term and/or late effects of cancer and its treatment. T he guidelines \nfocus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment \nof cancer can have on the adult survivor's  health,  physical and mental  \nstates, health behaviors, professional and personal identity, sexuality , and \nfinancial standing . \nThe panel acknowledges  that there is a growing population of cancer \nsurvivors with chronic cancer. This group includes those with incurable \ndisease who are receiving  systemic therapy  continuously  and those  who \nmay be  on treatment  intermittently. Although these guidelines do not \naddress the specific needs of survivors with chronic cancer (eg, \npsychosocial issues related to living for years with a terminal diagnosis \nand u ncertainty about the future; how to handle comorbid conditions and \ndisease prevention, screening, and treatment in the setting of limited life \nexpectancy; managing discussions around new drugs and early -stage \nclinical trials ),15 many of the recommendations in these guidelines are relevant to this population (eg, those around fatigue, anxiety, depression ). \nThe panel emphasizes that these guidelines may be used to guide the \nmanagement of all cancer survivors \u2013 not just those who have completed \ntreatment, but also the population with chronic cancer.  \nThese guidelines  should be used as a supplement to the follow -up \nrecommendations within the disease -specific guidelines (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site, available at www.NCCN.org ) \nand should provide a framework for the coordination of care between the \nsurvivor\u2019s health care providers to ensure that needs are appropriately \naddressed.  \nThese guidelines are not intended to provide guidance for the care of \nsurvivors of childhood cancer (detailed guidelines for the care of childhood \ncancer survivors are available from the Children\u2019s Oncology Group at \nhttp://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/ ). For survivorship issues related to \nyounger populations,  please also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent \nand Young Adult  (AYA) Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org ). For \nsurvivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune -\nmediated toxicities is warranted (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nManagement of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nFor this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Surv ivorship, the panel \nfocused on the preventive health issues including healthy lifestyle \nbehaviors, immunizations and prevention of infection, and cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD) risk assessment and modification . The panel also focused \non several common issues  of survivors: 1) anthracycline -induced cardiac \ntoxicity; 2) anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress; 3) cognitive decline; \n4) fatigue; 5) lymphedema; 6) hormone -related symptoms; 7) pain; 8) \nfemale and male sexual dysfunction;  and 9)  sleep disorders.

Although achieving all of these healthy lifestyle goals may be \ndifficult for many survivors, eve n small reductions in weight among \noverweight or obese survivors or small increases in physical activity \namong sedentary individuals are thought to yield meaningful \nimprovements in cancer -specific outcomes and overall health.202 Clinicians \nshould assess individual and  community -level barriers to meeting the \nhealthy lifestyle recommendations and support patients in developing \nstrategies to overcome challenges.  \nPhysical Activity  \nDuring cancer treatment, many survivors become deconditioned and can \ndevelop impaired cardiov ascular fitness because of the direct and \nsecondary effects of therapy.203 Randomized trials have shown that \nexercise training is safe, tolerable, and effective for most survivors. \nStructured aerobic and resistance training programs after treatment can \nimprove  cardiovascular fitness and strength and can have positive effects \non balance, body composition, fatigue, emotional well -being, and quality of \nlife.204-216 The effectiveness of exercise is especially well studied in \npatients  with early -stage breast cancer. Survivors of breast cancer who \nexercise have  improved cardiovascular fitness and therefore an increased \ncapacity to perform daily life functions, resulting in a better quality of \nlife.214,215,217 -219 Furthermore, a study of adult survivors of childhood \nHodgkin lymphoma  found that vigorous exercise was associated with a \nreduction in the risk of  major  cardiovascular  event s after a median follow -\nup of 11.9 years.220 In fact, the finding was dose -dependent, and survivors \nwho reported \u22659 metabolic equivalent (MET ) h/wk experienced a 51% \nreduction in risk compared with those reporting <9 MET h/wk (P = .002).  A similar study in patients with breast cancer found a similar reduction in the \nrisk of cardiovascular events  with \u22659 MET h/wk .221 \nIn addition, observational studies have consistentl y found that p hysical  \nactivity is linked to decreased cancer incidence and recurrence and \nincreased survival for certain tumor types.209,222 -239 For example, one meta -\nanalysis of 6 studies including more than 12,000 survivors of breast \ncancer found that post -diagnosis physical activity reduced all -cause \nmortality by 41% ( P < .00001)  and disease recurrence by 24% ( P = \n.00001).226 Data from other meta -analyses primarily consisting of \nobservational studies of survivors of colorectal, ovarian, non -small cell \nlung, brain, prostate, and breast cancers show that physical activity is \nassociated with decreased all -cause mortality and/or cancer -specific \nmortality.224,227,236,240 In fact, analyses of data from 986 survivors of breast \ncancer  from the National Ru nners' and Walkers' Health Studies  found that \nmortality decreased with increased rates of energy expenditure.237 \nEvidence in other disease sites is less robust, but also suggests survival \nbenefits associated with exercise in survivors after treatment.240 \nData also support the idea that inactivity/sedentary behavior is  a risk factor \nfor cancer incidence  and mortality and impacts mood and quality of life in \nsurvivors,  independent of the level of an individual\u2019s recreational or \noccupational physical activity.192,241 -247 For example, i n a cohort of more \nthan 2000 survivors of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, those who spent \nmore leisure time sitting had a higher  mortality than those who spent more \ntime in recreational activity.192 \nEvaluation

See NCCN Distress Thermometer Screening Tool (DIS-A)\n \u25caScreening for anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress should be a part of routine care. The panel recommends using validated \nmeasures such as the PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, PC-PTSD-5 for trauma (also see Trauma Screening [SANXDE-D] ), NCCN \nDistress Thermometer Screening Tool (DIS-A) , or PROMIS measures. \n\u0017Clinical assessments should include and evaluate psychosocial aspects of a survivor's background, including trauma (SANXDE-7) .\n\u0017Caregivers and all family members of the survivor, including younger children, are vulnerable to the same psychosocial stresses and \nsymptoms as survivors, though often at different times or for different reasons. If needs are observed, they can be offered resources and \nreferred for evaluation.\n\u2022 This algorithm is intended for oncologists and other health care providers to screen for distress, anxiety, and depression in cancer \nsurvivors, to provide steps for addressing these concerns with survivors, and to facilitate decisions about referral to specialists. \n\u0017The algorithm is not intended as a psychiatric diagnosis and treatment tool.\n\u0017The algorithm focuses on more common mood disorders after cancer. It does not screen or address treatment for psychiatric conditions \nsuch as bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, personality disorders, or obsessive compulsive disorders. Diagnosis and management of these \ndisorders should be done by a mental health professional (NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management).\n\u2022 Decisions about treatment and referral will depend on the acuteness of onset of symptoms, their intensity, and safety of the survivor and \nothers (SANXDE-6  and SANXDE-A ).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfa3e526-2484-457e-b125-941432337411": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfa3e526-2484-457e-b125-941432337411", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9705fc69-7c19-4cbd-a755-e266cde245b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "9fb935a775257026b367e191032a0fb3651874a845fc3a28b51678881a9ac138"}}, "hash": "9fb935a775257026b367e191032a0fb3651874a845fc3a28b51678881a9ac138", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-46 patients  randomized to the education plus exercise arm self -reported \ngreater range of motion  at 12 months after lymph node dissection (a pre -\nspecified secondary outcome) compared with patients  in the education \nonly arm (left, 91% vs . 84%; P = .16; right, 90% vs . 83%; P = .02 ).779 \nFinally, survivors can be informed that w ater exercise under supervision \nmay be an option to consider in the absence of  any skin integrity and/or \nincision issues.780 In a controlled clinical intervention study, 88 patients \nwith lymphedema second ary to cancer participated in either a water -based \nor land -based exercise program .780 A higher proportion of those  who \nperformed water exercises experienced a reduction in  their secondary arm \nlimb volume ( P = .029)  and self -reported frequency of swelling ( P = .031) . \nSurveillance of Survivors with Lymphedema  \nSurvivors with lymphedema should have follow -up with the treat ment team \nas clinically indicated.

This increased risk is due to genetic susceptibilities (eg, \nhereditary cancer syndromes) and/or family history, shared etiologic exposures (eg, smoking, environmental exposures, health behaviors, \nhuman papillomavirus [HPV]), and mutagenic effects of cancer treatment. Health behaviors should be modified as possible (eg, smoking \ncessation, weight management) to decrease the risk of subsequent malignancies.\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyle and behavioral counseling are important to reduce risk factors that may contribute to subsequent cancers (HL-1).\n\u2022 Treatment-related subsequent primary cancers vary with the type and intensity of anticancer treatment and are associated in particular with \nRT and specific chemotherapeutic agents.

If symptoms are present, survivors should be asked \nabout the frequency and severity of swelling, pain and/or discomfort, any \nissues with strength or range of motion and mobi lity (ie, bending, \nstretching, flexibility), and whether symptoms interfere with daily activities.  \nIf lymphedema symptoms are present, a recurrence of cancer should be \nruled out. The survivor should then be referred to a certified lymphedema \ntherapist, if available, for additional assessments. These assessments can \ninclude subjective signs and symptoms of lymphedema and limb volume \nmeasurements. Ideally, pretreatment limb measurement of both sides \nshould be performed as a baseline prior to ini tiation of any therapy for \nthose with treatment -related or individual risk factors. If not, the \ncontralateral limb can be used for comparison in the post -treatment \nsetting. Clinical examination by a lymphedema therapist may include \nrange of motion, muscle performance, circulation, sensation, \nhemodynamic monitoring, and functional mobility.   \nSurvivors with lymphedema should also be assessed for distress (see \nAnxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Distress , above).  \nTreatment of Lymphedema  \nHigh-level evidence suppo rting treatments for lymphedema are lacking, \nand most studies have been performed in breast cancer survivors.31,760 -762 \nMost of the recommendations  made by the panel are thus based on lower -\nlevel evidence, clinical experience, and expert consensus.  \nThe oncology team should provide education regarding self -care \nmanagement, including i nfection prevention measures, risk -reduction \nstrategies, and mainten ance of skin integrity on the affected side  (see \nSurvivor Lymphedema Education , below).  Distress should be treated if present (see Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Distress , above). Referral \nshould be made to a certified lymphedema therapist, if available,  for \nprescription and fitting of c ompression garments , performance of manual \nlymphatic drainage, and direction of supervised progressive strength \ntraining . If a certified lymphedema therapist is not available, referral to an \nappropriate alternative provide r for treatment  should be consider ed. \nCompression garments have been shown to reduce limb volume, and are \noften used with other modalities such as manual lymphatic drainage.762-764 \nManual lymphatic drainage is performed by a specific massage technique \ndesigned to encourage lymph fluid  to drain from the affected area. \nSystematic reviews and meta -analyses hav e assessed the efficacy of \nmanual lymphatic drainage in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema \nand found that it can provide additional benefit when added to standard \ntherapy.765,766 In particular, compression bandaging al one leads to  limb \nvolume reductions of 30% to 3 9%, and manual lymphatic drainage \nappears to increase that reduction by  an additional 7%.  \nProgressive strength training and physical activity are not associated with \nexacerbation or development of lymphedema , and may improve \nlymphedema symptoms .214,255 -259,767 -770 The WISER Survivor trial \nrandomized 351 overweight breast cancer survivors with  lymphedema to a \ncontrol group that received hospital -based care, a

The panel recognizes that not all individuals with a history of cancer identify with the term \"survivor.\" These guidelines \nare meant to be inclusive and use the term \"survivor\" to describe anyone with a history of cancer.\n\u2022 These guidelines focus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer have on the adult survivor. This \nincludes the potential impact on physical and mental states, health behaviors, professional and personal identity , sexuality, and financial \nstanding. It is appropriate to counsel on these impacts early in the treatment trajectory and at regular intervals thereafter.\n\u2022 These guidelines are applicable to survivors across the continuum of care, including those on prolonged therapy, those with chronic \ncancers (eg, metastatic disease), and long-term survivors.\n\u2022 The panel recognizes the growing population of individuals who are living with metastatic disease and that many aspects of these guidelines \npertain to this population of survivors. This group is included in the definition of survivorship, and these guidelines are meant to be applied \nwhen helpful to meet the individuals' needs. \n\u2022 The panel recommends reviewing the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship in conjunction with the cancer-specific guidelines for individuals \nwith metastatic disease. As more evidence is established for this population, more specific survivorship guidelines for individuals living with \nmetastatic cancers may be developed..\n\n\n\n\nSURV-1", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5e84b97-e5e1-4b91-9304-f7bb969ddddc": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5e84b97-e5e1-4b91-9304-f7bb969ddddc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "79272d36-26e2-42b1-a28d-d8ceef2896f7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "9b8788318f357052d59dbb071dc11206f9cc627d25e27bd6110b019428d29342"}}, "hash": "9b8788318f357052d59dbb071dc11206f9cc627d25e27bd6110b019428d29342", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Pain\n\n\nSPAIN-3UNIVERSAL SCREENING ASSESSMENT CANCER PAIN \nSYNDROMESTREATMENTd\nScreen for \ncancer pain \nor cancer \ntreatment- \nrelated pain \nat regular \nintervalsPain \nrelated to \ncancer\nNo pain \nAnticipated \npainful events \nand proceduresRescreen at each \nsubsequent visitComprehensive pain \nassessment (see [PAIN-B] \nin the NCCN Guidelines  \nfor Adult Cancer Pain) in \norder to identify pain\n\u2022 Etiologyc\n\u2022 Pathophysiology\n\u2022 Determine patient goals \nfor comfort and function\n\u2022 Specific cancer pain \nsyndrome \nSee Procedure-Related  \nPain and Anxiety (PAIN-J) \nin the NCCN Guidelines  \nfor Adult Cancer Pain\u2022 Quantify pain intensity \nand characterize \nquality \n\u0017See Pain Intensity \nRating (PAIN-A) \nin the NCCN  \nGuidelines for Adult  \nCancer Pain \n\u2022 Severe uncontrolled \npain is a medical \nemergency and \nshould be addressed \npromptly\n\u0017Rule out oncologic \nemergencyNeuropathic pain\nChronic pain syndromes \n(amputation, neck dissection, \nmastectomy, thoracotomy)\nMyalgias, arthralgias\nSkeletal pain\nMyofascial pain\nGI/urinary/pelvic pain\nPost-radiation pain(SPAIN-4)\n(SPAIN-5)\n(SPAIN-6)\n(SPAIN-7)\n(SPAIN-8)\n(SPAIN-9)\n(SPAIN-10)\nc Referral to PCP for non-cancer treatment-related workup and pain management (ie, rheumatoid arthritis) and consider the possibility of pain due to cancer recurrence.\nd General Principles of Pain Management (SPAIN-1).Lymphedema (SLYMPH-1)Pain \nunrelated \nto cancerRefer to primary care \nor other specialists \nspecializing in treatment \nof a particular painful \ncondition", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8713adb6-3a0c-46aa-99f9-68993b1fcd2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8713adb6-3a0c-46aa-99f9-68993b1fcd2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84e5f470-0e84-41ff-b81f-e4eb051b4564", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "2919647c04d52cf1a323408044d29fb4a22701dba5cdc79d722827c251723393"}}, "hash": "2919647c04d52cf1a323408044d29fb4a22701dba5cdc79d722827c251723393", "text": "Physical activity  Tips for achieving goals\n 2 Physical activity  Tips for achieving goals | Review\nTips for achieving goals\nPhysical activity is a life-long pursuit.

However, discussions about work are ideally best had before treatment begins so that treatment recommendations \ncan take work needs into consideration if possible. \n\u2022 Symptoms affecting work may wax and wane with a survivor\u2019s treatments or disease status, especially if they are living chronically with \ncancer or the consequences of cancer treatment. Some survivors might start and stop working more than once.\n\u2022 Most existing literature focuses on unemployment and/or those who do not return to work. However, underemployment and/or work \nlimitations due to cancer or side effects are also common.\n\u2022 Employment helps to protect survivors from financial toxicity and, at least in the United States, is frequently tied to health insurance access. \nThis can be a main reason survivors work even when/if they are not fully recovered.\n\u2022 Employment is an important source of personal interaction, normalcy , and social support. The psychosocial effects/advantages derived from \nwork may include a sense of purpose, emotional well-being, link to identity , improved quality of life, connection with others, and distraction.\n\u2022 Some populations are at increased risk for difficulties related to work (based on factors such as gender , age, race, ethnicity, cancer type, \ncancer stage, rural residence, educational attainment, etc). The increased difficulties in these populations are more likely for survivors \nwith physically or cognitively demanding jobs or jobs with limited flexibility in scheduling or tasks. Additionally, patients with cancer may \nexperience discrimination as a result of diagnosis/illness, and this may be a consideration for some individuals in decisions surrounding \nemployment.\n\u2022 Survivors should be offered information to help them understand their likely ability to work, take into account their finances and personal/\nfamily needs, and discuss potential work accommodations with their employers.1 \n\u2022 Clinicians should regularly re-evaluate work-related concerns post active cancer treatment or for persons living chronically with cancer .\n\u0017Periodically identify goals and barriers regarding work with survivor  (SWORK-3).\n\u0017A team approach may be needed. Consider early involvement of social work, primary care, physical therapy/occupational therapy, cancer \nrehabilitation, and/or career counseling services, if available.\n\u0017Employment disability forms are not typically well-suited to cancer . However, clinicians should consider the survivor\u2019s needs for flexibility \nin tasks and hours, and other workplace accommodations as a starting point for filling out the necessary forms.

This technique is widely available and ine xpensive, \ngives no radiation exposure, and is the  most useful diagnostic test in the \nevaluation  of patients with possible heart failure .502,503 It can recognize  \nearly stages of heart failure by revealing abnormalities of the pericardium , \nmyocardium, and heart valves.494 While r adionuclide ventriculography  \n(also called  radionuclide angiography  or MUG A scan)  can provide  \naccurate measurements of left ventricular size and function and \nassessment of ventricular enlargement, it cannot  assess  valvular \nabnormalities or cardiac  hypertrophy  and exposes patients to radiation .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f8b07f7-8aea-4672-9b6b-71598f08a989": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f8b07f7-8aea-4672-9b6b-71598f08a989", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e271e69d-ab9c-40a6-8248-4546b8f48003", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "95d5987e5c937b7c729714b797aed7b99f495a541363e97b563c02506c9d6167"}}, "hash": "95d5987e5c937b7c729714b797aed7b99f495a541363e97b563c02506c9d6167", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Distress \n\n\nIn the past two weeks, have you\u2026\n1.

It occurs when lymph fluid accumulates in the \ninterstitial tissue, causing swelling of the limb or other areas such as the \nneck, trunk, or genitals. Lymphedema is most often diagnosed within 18 \nmonths of treatment; however, it can develop any time in the life of the \nsurvivor.  \nMore than 20% of cancer  survivors reported lymphedema as a physical \nconcern in a survey of almost 14 million  survivors in the United States in a \n2010 LIVESTRONG study .23 The incidence of lymphedema varies by \ndisease site.

Injury or stress on the myocardium (such as during and after \ntreatment with anthracyclines) can lead to activation of endogenous \nneurohormonal systems, which play a critical role i n cardiac remodeling \nand therefore progre ssion to Stage B heart failure.  \nThe panel recommends that heart failure risk factors, including \nhypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome , and diabetes , be addressed in \nall survivors  who have completed anthracycline  therapy . In addition, \nsurvivors with a history of anthracycline therapy should be advised to  \nengage in regular physical activity, eat a healthy diet, and avoid behaviors \nthat may increase the risk of heart failure or CVD  (eg, cigarette/ tobacco or \nillicit drug use). Physical activity has been shown to improve control of \nhypertension and to slow cardiac remodeling in breast cancer survivors \nwith heart failure.507 Involvement of the survivor\u2019s primary care provider in \nmanaging risk factors is encouraged.  \nThe panel recommends that a low threshold be established for referral to a \ncardio -oncologist or cardiologist for all patients previously treated with an \nanthracycline. Additional recommendations for each sta ge of heart failure \nare discussed below.  Treatment of Stage A Heart Failure  \nStage A heart failure recognizes several well -established risk factors , each \nof which contribute to early stage s of heart failure. These include \nhypertension, CAD , diabetes mellitus, a family history of heart failure , or a \nhistory of cardiotoxins such as anthracyclines. Therefore, all survivors  with \nexposure to anthracyclines have, by definition, at least one risk factor that \npredisposes them to cardiac disease  and s hould be treated  as \nappropriate. Other anti -cancer systemic therapies are potentially \ncardiotoxic and may increase the risk of cardiac disease.439 Involvement of \nthe survivor\u2019s PCP in the management of survivors with cardiac risk \nfactors is encouraged.

Secondary hypogonadism is a disease of the \npituitary or hypothalamus. In survivors  with secondary hypogonadism, \nserum testosterone levels and sperm counts are subnormal, and the \nserum LH and FSH levels are normal or reduced. Adult -onset \nhypogonadism is characterized by a deficiency of testosterone and a \nfailure of the body to produce an adequate compensatory response. In \nthese individuals , low testosterone levels are associated with normal or \nlow levels of gonadotropins, suggesting physiologic failure of both the \ntesticles and hypothalamic -pituitary system.1080 Evaluation and Assessment for Sexual Function  \nAll adult cancer survivors, regardless of gender identity and sexual \norientation, should be ask ed about their sexual function at regular \nintervals, by inquiring about any concerns or distress regarding sexual \nfunction, sexual activity, sexual relationships, or sex life .

Furthermore, the oncologic history of the survivor \nshould be revi ewed. Chest radiation can increase the risk of ischemic \ncardiac disease, which can contribute to heart failure.436,442,448,495 The \naddition of other cardiotoxic therapies (eg, HER2 -targeted agents) to \nanthracyclines can further incr ease the risk of heart failure over that seen \nwith the use of anthracyclines alone.496 Older survivors, those w ith a \nhigher cumulative anthracycline dose  (cumulative doxorubicin dose of 250 \nmg/m2 or equivalent497), those with underlying CVD  or risk factors, and \nthose who had a low -normal (50% \u201354%) baseline ejection fraction are \nalso at increased risk for the development of heart failure. Recent data \nalso showed that being o verweight or obes e and v isceral and \nintramuscular adiposity  are risk factors  for cardiotoxi city from \nanthracyclines  in breast cancer survivors.498,499 In addition, the risk of \ncardiac events and death  in survivors of breast cancer has been shown to \nincrease as the number of cardiovascular risk factors increases.500  \nImaging  \nWhen developing these imaging guidelines for screening for cardiac \ntoxicity in survivors with a history of anthracycline exposure, the panel \nconsidered several questions: 1) Is the prevalence of structural heart \ndisease h igh enough to warrant screening of anthracycline -treated \nsurvivors ?; 2) Is an abnormal echocardiogram post -anthracycline therapy \nassociated with  an increased risk  for the future development of \nsymptomatic heart failure ?; and 3) Does the recognition of  cardiac \nabnormalities  and treatment  of cardiac risk factors  post-anthracycline \ntherapy  affect outcomes ? \nAs for the prevalence of structural heart disease in patients treated with \nanthracyclines, a  study of 2625 patients with cancer (mostly breast cancer or non -Hodgkin lymphoma) assessed LVEF be fore, every 3 months during \nanthracycline chemotherapy and during the following year, every 6 months \nfor the next 4 years, and annual after that.464 Cardiotoxicity, defined as \nLVEF  <50%  and decreas ed by >10 absolute points, was observed in 9% \nof the study population. In the large randomized controlled NSABP B -31 \ntrial, cardiac function was assessed by cardiac imaging in patients after \ninitial anthracycline -based therapy as a requirement for further treatment \nwith trastuzumab.501 Over 7% of patients experienced cardiac symptoms \nand/or a decrease in LVEF of >15% after receiving anthracyclines, thus \nexcluding them from being considered for trastuzumab. It is important to \nnote that this was a clinical trial patient population without significant \ncardiac risk factors or history of cardiac disease. In a non -clinical trial \npopulation of patients with cancer, many may already have cardiac risk \nfactors or actual cardiomyopathy pr ior to treatment, thus elevating the risk \nof developing heart failure. Together, these results indicate that a \nsignificant proportion of survivors with early -onset Stage B or greater heart \nfailure can be identified with appropriate imaging after therapy.

Common barriers include not having enough time \nto exercise, not hav ing access to an acceptable exercise environment, \nuncertainty about safety of exercise post -treatment, lack of knowledge \nregarding appropriate activities, and physical limitations.250 Alleviation of \npain, fatigue, distress, or nutritional deficits can facilitate the initiation of an \nexercise program.  \nRisk Assessment for Exercise -Induced Adverse Events  \nExercise is considered safe for most survivors .214,215,251 However, a \nsignificant portion of survivors may have comorbid conditions or risk \nfactors that make them unable to safely exercise without trained \nsupervision.252 Therefore, a risk assessment is required for all survivors \nbefore prescribing a specific exercise program.214,253 The type of cancer, \ntreatment modalities received, and the number and severity of \ncomorbidities determine risk levels.251 Thus, disease and treatment \nhistory, late and long -term effects, and comorbidities should be assessed. \nA standardized pre-participa tion screening questionnaire, such as the \nPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone  (PAR-Q+),254 can \nalso be considered to identify patients for whom unsupervised physical \nactivity is likely safe versus those for whom it may pose undue risk.  \nSurvivors with peripheral neuropathy, poor bone health, a rthritis , or \nmusculoskeletal issues  are considered to be at moderate risk for exercise -\ninduced adverse events. Stability , balance,  and gait should be assessed in \nsurvivors with peripheral neuropathy and possibly in survivors with poor \nbone health before they engage  in exercise , and exercise choice should \nbe made based on the results (ie, stationary bike or water aerobics for \nsurvivors with poor balance).  In addition, balance training can be \nrecommended for patients at risk for  falls. Moderate -risk survivors can \noften follow the general recommendations for physical activity; however, medical clearance and/or referrals to trained personnel such as a physical \nor occupational therapist, certified exercise professional , or rehabilit ation \nspecialist can also be considered.  Specialized training in working with \nsurvivors is available for both physical therapists and exercise \nprofessionals through the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM; \nhttp://www.acsm.org/get -certified ) and the American Physical Therapy \nAssociation (APTA) Oncology section ( http://oncologypt.org/ ).
