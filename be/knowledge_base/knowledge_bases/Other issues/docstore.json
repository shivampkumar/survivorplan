effect on work status, \nperformance, and satisfaction.87 Survivors often take long breaks from or \neven leave their jobs during treatment, and returning to work after cancer \ntreatment can be critical to restoring normalcy to the lives of survivors. \nHowever, survivors may be left with di sabilities or late/long -term effects \nthat decrease their employment prospects or ability to perform at their \nprevious levels. Several studies have shown that unemployment rates for \nsurvivors are higher than for the general population.87-90 Furthermore, \nthose survivors who do return to work often encounter difficulties, such as \nphysical or c ognitive limitations, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and \nperceived or real discrimination.87,91,92 \nSeveral studies  have addressed factors that predict a delayed return to \nwork.93-99 For example, a French p opulation -based study revealed that \nclinical factors, such as severity of the cancer, receipt of chemotherapy , or \nthe experience of adverse effec ts, were associated with a delay in return \nto work.97 In addition, a systematic review of cohort studies found that \nsurvivors who were o lder, had a lower educa tion level, or had a  lower \nincome  were less likely to return to work.98 Another systematic review \nidentified factors related to the person ( eg, symptoms, coping, motivation), \nenvironmental supports ( eg, family, workplace), and occupation ( eg, type \nof work, job flexibility)  that impacted successful return to work after cancer \ntreatment.100 \nSome interventions to enhance return -to-work in cancer survivors have \nbeen studied (eg, psycho -education , physical training, vocational \ncounseling ), although additional research in this area is greatly needed .101-\n104 Multidisciplinary interventions that combine vocational counseling with \nother elements (eg,  patient education, patient counseling, behavioral \ntraining , physical exercises ) may increase rates of  return -to-work \ncompared to usual care.  Financial Burden  \nThe LIVESTRONG 2012  Survey found that approximately 33% of working -\nage survivors went into debt and 3% had filed for bankruptcy.105 The ACS  \nStudy of Cancer Survivors II  found that 20% of survivors reported unmet \nfinancial needs.24 A study in Washington state found that patients with \ncancer have a 2.6 -fold increase d risk of bankruptcy.106 In another study, \n38% of patients with stage III colon cancer reported financial hardship  \nresulting from cancer treatment, defined as  accruing debt, selling or \nrefinancing  a home, borrow ing money from friends or family, or \nexperienc ing a \u226520% decline in annual income .107 Another study found \nthat, in addition to the average >$16,000 excess economic burden  that \npatients feel in th e early phases of cancer treatment, survivors (>1 year \nfrom diagnosis) have an average annual excess economic burden  that \nexceeds $4,000.108,109 Much of this excess burden was because of excess \nmedical expenditures. A more r ecent study found that the excess annual \nhealth  care expenditures of cancer survivors averaged about $4400, and \nthat the t otal mean annual direct health care expenditure for cancer \nsurvivors  increased by about $1000 in the period from 2009 to 2010 to the \nperiod from  2015  to 2016 .109 Other recent studies also found  that cancer \nsurvivors have greater out -of-pocket expenses and are more likely to \nexperience material hardship than those without a history of cancer.110,111 \nYounger cancer survivors seem to be particular ly vulnerable to the \nfinancial effects of cancer.111-113 \nClearly, with lost wages and increased expenses, the fin ancial burden on \nmany cancer survivors is great.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

This assessment can be done by the oncologist or \nPCP. Shared , coordinated care between the oncology , primary care , and \nsubspecialty care  provider s is encouraged.  Depending on the cancer type \nand stage of disease, transition of care to primary care may be done when \ndeemed clinically appropriate, with referral back to oncologic care as \nneeded. The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be \naddressed at every visit.  \nSome tools that screen for long -term and late physical and psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment in survivors  have been validated.171-176 \nIn addition, the NCCN Survivorship Panel  created a sample screening \ninstrument  that is guideline -specific and can be self-administered or \nadministered by an interviewer . This assessment tool was developed \nspecifically for use in co mbination with the NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship to help providers deliver necessary and comprehensive \nsurvivorship care. Although this instrument has not yet been piloted or \nvalidated, t he answers can be used to guide  providers to  topics within the \nguidelines that require  more in -depth assessment  via validated tools \nand/or clinical evaluation.  \nIn addition  to screening by history and physical examination , care \nproviders should assess the following  at regular intervals:  \n1.

Survivors \nundergoing certain treatments, such as mantle field radiation or certain \nsystemic therapies, may be at increased risk for subsequent malignancies. \nThose survivors who continue to smoke are at increased risk for smoking -\nrelated comorbidities and subsequent primary cancers.  \nReassessment  \nSurvivors should be followed and reassessed at regular intervals, \ndepending on the nature and severity of late and long -term effects being \ntreated . At each time point, assessment of disease status and ongoing \neffects of cancer and its treatment should be addressed.

In addition, lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of \nsubsequent primary cancers (eg, smoking cessation, physical activity, \nweight loss) should be encouraged.64 Finally, referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates, such as those with a cancer diagnosis at a young age or with \nmultiple primary cancers , to identify those with a potential increased risk  \nfor subsequent malignancies.65 Family cancer history should be \nperiodically updated to reassess hereditary risk, because it should not be \nassumed that all cancer survivors were assessed at diagnosis. Gen etic \ntesting guidelines and knowledge about hereditary cancer risk evolve over \ntime, and new family diagnoses may occur making periodic assessment \nimportant . Genetic risk assessment is appropriate for all survivors  of \nbreast cancer , epithelial ovarian cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, \npancreatic cancer, and colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed at age \n50 years or younger. Many other survivors of rare cancers, cancers \ndiagnosed at young ages, multiple primary cancers, or those  with one or \nmore relatives with the same or related cancers are also candidates for \nrisk assessment per guidelines from NCCN and other expert groups.

Identificati on and management of fatigue remain an \nunmet need for many cancer survivors.  \nThe specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of cancer -\nrelated fatigue are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include pro -\ninflammatory cytokines, hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis \ndysregulation, circadian rhythm desynchronization, skeletal muscle \nwasting, and genetic dysregulation.681-686 Several studies have focused on \nthe cause of fatigue, especially in cancer survivors with no evidence of \nactive disease, and have su ggested that persistent immune system \nactivation and chronic inflammatory processes may be involved.666,687 -689 \nEvidence supporting these mechanisms is limited.  \nScreening for Fatigue  \nAll survivors should be screened for fatigue to ensure that those with \nmoderate to severe fatigue are identified and treated promptly and \neffectively. Because fatigue is a subjective experience, clinicians must rely \non patients\u2019 descriptions of their fatigue level. The panel recommends the \nuse of a severity scale, with survivors being asked, \u201cHow would you rate \nyour fatigue on a scale of 0 t o 10 over the past 7 days?\u201d Alternatively, screening can be performed with patients asked to rate their fatigue as \nnone, mild, moderate, or severe. Scores of 0 to 3 or none to mild fatigue \nrequire no further assessment or interventions; these patients shou ld be \nrescreened at regular intervals. Patients with scores of 4 or greater or \nindicating moderate or severe fatigue should be evaluated further. Studies \nin patients with cancer have revealed a marked decrease in physical \nfunctioning at a reported fatigue level of 7 or higher on the 0 to 10 \nscale.690,691 \nEvaluation for Moderate to Severe Fatigue  \nWhen fatigue is rated as moderate to severe, with a score of 4 to 10, a \nmore focused history and physical examination should be conducted. A \nthorough history is warranted, because the recommended workup for \nfatigue differs according to the timing of fatigue onset in relation to the \ncompletion of active therapy and the presence of predisposing factors and \nother symptoms. Fatigue has a variable natural history, with some patients \ncomplain ing of only mild levels of fatigue even during active therapy and \nothers experiencing severe fatigue for years after treatment completion.  \nIn general, mild to moderate levels of fatigue that persist for 6 to 12 \nmonths after the completion of therapy do not warrant an extensive \nworkup, unless other symptoms are present. Conversely, when moderate \nto severe fatigue begins after or worsens during  this period, or when other \nsymptoms are present, such as pain, pulmonary complaints, or \nunintentional weight loss, a more extensive workup is warranted to screen \nfor the presence of metastatic disease or other comorbidities. Refer ral to a \npulmonologist should be made for pulmonary complaints . \nRegardless of fatigue onset, it is always relevant to screen for common \ncontributing factors such as emotional distress, sleep disturbance, pain, \nand the use of prescriptions or over -the-counter medications or \nsupplem ents.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ad5e9d3-0c9a-49a7-9a5e-6f45db9722c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ad5e9d3-0c9a-49a7-9a5e-6f45db9722c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be3a2674-63e9-43eb-b7ed-a6a467c53f09", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "68f0e34faad7036cb08c6145827bbf92023199ad9d48dcf64baf43855f5e2a56"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffdccc4d-8763-433b-b238-b4d999bb7b98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "c2d22d86eb3504124e2c411e83c3171e06d9fab4bd23fb3e3aac80ac5a62440d"}}, "hash": "09d1979b81d942245c9fdd6f64c3f42c64bbf214b16f0344a28e581c6c2aecf9", "text": "Possible medical causes of fatigue, including cardiac \ndisease, gastrointestinal or hepatic dysfunction, and hypothyroidism ,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "030afd85-84ed-4c58-8776-8604d2f62971": {"__data__": {"id_": "030afd85-84ed-4c58-8776-8604d2f62971", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e89671c3-27a5-403d-bf4c-2ac42623282f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "ae43579617ee94cf3767b015f2162a0880152c9a55b91d1aabc7d472183b1ace"}}, "hash": "ae43579617ee94cf3767b015f2162a0880152c9a55b91d1aabc7d472183b1ace", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-12 and improved adherence to guideline recommendations for health \nbehaviors.  \nSurvivorship Research  \nThe IOM survivorship report  cites a paucity of  longitudinal cohort studies \nlinking specific cancer types or treatments with specific late effect s, \nmaking it difficult to predict risk for individual patients.28 Research is \nneeded to increase understanding of the prevalence of, mechanisms of, \nand risks factors for late and long -term effects of cancer and its treatme nt. \nIn addition, research is needed to better define interventions that relieve \nsymptoms, restore function, and improve the quality of life of survivors.177 \nFinally, research can help better define optimal follow -up and surveillance \nschedules for cancer survivors after treatment.178,179 \nAn ASCO survey report highlighted several key gaps in current \nsurvivorship research.180 For instance, more research pertaining to \nsurvivors >65 years of age, to survivors of cancers other than breast, and \nto long -term survivors (>5 years) is needed. In addition, research focused \non patterns and quality of survivorship care  is lacking. A study of NIH \nsurvivorship grants in fiscal year 2016 showed a need for research \nincluding more diverse cancer types, older and longer -term survivors, and \nmore ethnoculturally diverse populations of survivors.181 \nIn June 2012, the ACS , CDC, LIVE STRONG  Foundation , and NCI held a \njoint meeting and created an action plan to facilitate the translation of \nsurvivorship research into survivorship care.182 The plan is driven by \ncollaboration between researchers, survivors, clinicians, and public health \nprofessionals; the use of technology, such as EHRs; analysis of \ninformation from the vie wpoints of multiple stakeholders; and the \nintegration and synthesis of knowledge using systematic reviews and \nmeta -analyses.  Recommendations for Preventive Health  \nAnalysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  \n(BRFSS)  indicates that a  large proportion of cancer survivors have \nsignificant comorbidities, smoke, are obese, and/or do not engage in \nphysical activity.183 Analysis of data from oth er studies, including the \nNational Health Interview Survey , showed similar results.184-187 Separate \nsurveys by the ACS and the CDC  found that 9.3% and 17% of survivors \nsmoke, respectively.186,188 In addition, many survivors forego \nrecommended cancer screenings (ie, co lorectal and cervical screening) \nand follow -up surveillance189-191 or demand more intense surveillance than \nevidence sup ports.84 \nHealthy Lifestyles  \nHealthy lifestyle habits, such as enga ging in routine physical activity, \nmaintaining a healthy diet and weight, and avoiding cigarette/ tobacco use, \nhave been associated with improved health outcomes and quality of life. \nFor some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been associated with a reduced \nrisk of recurrence and death .192-199 In fact, the maintenance of a healthy \nlifestyle is associated with a decrease in premature death in cancer \nsurvivors.200 Therefore,  survivors should be encouraged to achieve and \nmaintain a healthy lifestyle , including  attention to weight management, \nphysical  activity, metabolic health, and dietary habits.  Setting incremental \ngoals for diet, physical activity, and weight management  should be \nadvised . Survivors should be counseled to limit alcohol intake and avoid or \nstop using cigarette/ tobacco products, with emphasis on tobacco \ncessation if the survivor is  a current smoker or user of smokeless tobacco \n(see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).201 Clinicians should also advise survivors to practice sun \nsafety habits  as appropriate, such as using a broad -spectrum sunscreen, \navoiding peak sun hours, and using physical barriers.

In \nfact, most cancer survivors rep ort being in good general health and \nexperience good to excellent quality of life.17,18 Also, a survey of 659 \nsurvivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers  found that a majority \ndo not suffer from psychologic morbidity or have a large number of unmet \nsupportive care need s.19,20 Other studies have similarly found that most \nsurvivors enjoy a high quality of life without a large number of cancer -\nrelated symptoms.21,22 \nHowever, many survivors do experience physical and/or psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment.23-25 Some sequelae become evident \nduring anticancer treatment (long -term effects), whereas others may not \nmanifest for months or years after active therapy (late effects).  The \nproblems can range from mild to severe,  debilitating, or even life -\nthreatening. Some problems are temporary or improve with time, whereas \nother problems are progressive or permanent. This topic has been well \nreviewed.18,26 \nA literature review suggests that at least 50% of survivors experience \nsome late effect s of cancer treatment.26 The most common problems in \ncancer survivors are depression , pain, and fat igue.27 The exact prevalence of various effects of cancer and its treatment are hard to quantify, because \nfew studies have addressed these issues in a longitudinal fashion, \ncomparing patients with and without a histo ry of cancer to differentiate \nbetween the effects of cancer and the effects of aging.18 In general, the \nprevalence of late effects in cancer survivo rs is believed to have increased \nover time, likely because anticancer interventions have become more \ncomplex and intense with combinations of surgery, radiation, \nchemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted biologics.28 \nPhysical Effects  \nPhysical effects of cancer and its treatment in cancer survivors include \npain, muscu loskeletal issues, fatigue, lack of stamina, urinary and bowel \nproblems , lymphedema , premature menopause, cognitive deficits, \ndiabetes, and sexual dysfunction.18,29 -32 The effects of cancer treatment on \nthe heart and bone are also well known.33-36 The type of physical effects \ndepends mainly on the treatment received.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

immunizations), and cancer screening reco mmendations.  \nThe panel made specific recommendations regarding physical activity, \nweight management, nutrition, and supplement use, which are discussed \nherein. Although achieving all of these healthy lifestyle goals may be \ndifficult for many survivors, eve n small reductions in weight among \noverweight or obese survivors or small increases in physical activity \namong sedentary individuals are thought to yield meaningful \nimprovements in cancer -specific outcomes and overall health.202 Clinicians \nshould assess individual and  community -level barriers to meeting the \nhealthy lifestyle recommendations and support patients in developing \nstrategies to overcome challenges.  \nPhysical Activity  \nDuring cancer treatment, many survivors become deconditioned and can \ndevelop impaired cardiov ascular fitness because of the direct and \nsecondary effects of therapy.203 Randomized trials have shown that \nexercise training is safe, tolerable, and effective for most survivors. \nStructured aerobic and resistance training programs after treatment can \nimprove  cardiovascular fitness and strength and can have positive effects \non balance, body composition, fatigue, emotional well -being, and quality of \nlife.204-216 The effectiveness of exercise is especially well studied in \npatients  with early -stage breast cancer. Survivors of breast cancer who \nexercise have  improved cardiovascular fitness and therefore an increased \ncapacity to perform daily life functions, resulting in a better quality of \nlife.214,215,217 -219 Furthermore, a study of adult survivors of childhood \nHodgkin lymphoma  found that vigorous exercise was associated with a \nreduction in the risk of  major  cardiovascular  event s after a median follow -\nup of 11.9 years.220 In fact, the finding was dose -dependent, and survivors \nwho reported \u22659 metabolic equivalent (MET ) h/wk experienced a 51% \nreduction in risk compared with those reporting <9 MET h/wk (P = .002).  A similar study in patients with breast cancer found a similar reduction in the \nrisk of cardiovascular events  with \u22659 MET h/wk .221 \nIn addition, observational studies have consistentl y found that p hysical  \nactivity is linked to decreased cancer incidence and recurrence and \nincreased survival for certain tumor types.209,222 -239 For example, one meta -\nanalysis of 6 studies including more than 12,000 survivors of breast \ncancer found that post -diagnosis physical activity reduced all -cause \nmortality by 41% ( P < .00001)  and disease recurrence by 24% ( P = \n.00001).226 Data from other meta -analyses primarily consisting of \nobservational studies of survivors of colorectal, ovarian, non -small cell \nlung, brain, prostate, and breast cancers show that physical activity is \nassociated with decreased all -cause mortality and/or cancer -specific \nmortality.224,227,236,240 In fact, analyses of data from 986 survivors of breast \ncancer  from the National Ru nners' and Walkers' Health Studies  found that \nmortality decreased with increased rates of energy expenditure.237 \nEvidence in other disease sites is less robust, but also suggests survival \nbenefits associated with exercise in survivors after treatment.240 \nData also support the idea that inactivity/sedentary behavior is  a risk factor \nfor cancer incidence  and mortality and impacts mood and quality of life in \nsurvivors,  independent of the level of an individual\u2019s recreational or \noccupational physical activity.192,241 -247 For example, i n a cohort of more \nthan 2000 survivors of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, those who spent \nmore leisure time sitting had a higher  mortality than those who spent more \ntime in recreational activity.192 \nEvaluation

consequences of cancer and cancer treatment. They \ncan be used to optimize health and wellness for all survivors; however, they were created to assist health care professionals who work with survivors \nof adult-onset cancer in the post-treatment period, including those in both the oncology and primary care practices. \n\u2022 The panel recognizes that many of the post-treatment issues covered in these Guidelines are best addressed before cancer treatment begins so that \nmany problems can be prevented or minimized.\n\u2022 These guidelines are designed to provide a framework for the general survivorship care and management of potential long-term and/or late effects of \ncancer and its treatment that survivors may experience.\n\u2022 The NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship should be used as a supplement to the follow-up recommendations within the disease-specific guidelines. See \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site and NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care for recommendations regarding metastatic disease. \n\u2022 These guidelines, with the appropriate disease-specific guideline, provide a framework for the coordination of care between the survivor's health care \nproviders to ensure that needs are appropriately addressed.\n\u2022 The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be addressed at every visit. The panel recommends periodic screening assessments and \nappropriate follow-up care as clinically indicated. \n\u2022 Referral to other health care disciplines/providers or community resources may be used to address several indications or identified issues with one \nintervention (eg, rehabilitation for fatigue, depression, and pain).\n\u2022 The panel recommends stakeholders ensure the implementation of guideline-concordant survivorship care within their unique health \nsystems.1  Specifically, institutions are encouraged to determine how to systematically deliver the six key components of survivorship care \n(SURV-1).1-3 There are several models of care that frame the implementation of survivorship care according to provider type(s), clinic type(s), \npatient risk, and other factors.4-7 Engaging these models of care will facilitate implementation planning.7 Panel members recommend \ninstitutions provide the resources necessary to plan, deliver, and evaluate their survivorship care program(s).1-2\n\u2022 For survivorship issues related to younger populations, also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and the \nChildren's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers  \n(www.survivorshipguidelines.org).\n\u2022 For survivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune-mediated toxicities is warranted.

Disease and treatment considerations also \naffect recommendations for screening, such as the inclusion  of \nechocardiograms for patients who received cardiotoxic treatments and \nthyroid screening for patients who received radiation to the neck or thorax \nor agents such as immunotherapies or small molecule TKIs.  \nManagement of Fatigue  \nSeveral interventions and strategies have been shown to help alleviate \nfatigue and reduce distress caused by this symptom in patients with \ncancer and survivors; recommended strategies and interventions are \ndescribed herein. For additional information about fatigue in survivors and \npatients with cancer, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer -Related \nFatigue (available at www.NCCN.org ). These guidelines may be modified \nto fit the individual survivor\u2019s circumstance s. \nTreatment of Contributing Factors  \nManagement of fatigue in survivors first includes the treatment of \ncontributing factors such as pain, distress, anemia, and sleep disturbances \n(more information on  the treatment of pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep \ndisorders in survivors can be found throughout these guidelines). In a \nrandomized controlled trial of 152 fatigued patients with advanced cancer, \ntreatment of accompanying physical symptoms, including pain, nausea, \nvomiting, and shortness of breath, resulted  in a significantly higher impact \non general fatigue, activity, and motivation than usual care.692 \nPatient and Family Education and Counseling  \nEducation and counseling can be beneficial in helping patients cope with \nfatigue. Understanding typical patterns of fatigue during and after \ntreatment can help patients set reasonable expectations regarding \nimprovements in energy after the completion of can cer therapy and can \nhelp allay concerns that persistent fatigue after the completion of therapy \nis evidence of disease recurrence. Counseling can help patients develop \nstrategies for self -monitoring of fatigue and techniques such as energy conservation tha t may be helpful in the immediate post -treatment \nperiod.693 \nPhysical Activity  \nActivity en hancement is a category 1 recommendation for the \nmanagement of fatigue in survivors. Improving strength, energy, and \nfitness through regular exercise, even a moderate -intensity walking \nprogram, has been shown to facilitate the transition from patient to \nsurvivor, decrease anxiety and depression, improve body image, and \nincrease tolerance for physical activity. Therefore, survivors with moderate \nto severe fatigue should be encouraged to maintain adequate levels of \nphysical activity (category 1). Robust data support the efficacy of \nincreased physical activity for reducing fatigue in patients with cancer and \nsurvivors.204,210,215,217,219,560,694 -700 Multiple meta -analyses of randomized \ncontrolled trials have found that cancer survivors who participate in \nexercise interventions, either during or after treatment for cancer, \nexperience significant improvements in fatigue com pared with patients \nrandomized to the control group.204,700 -703 A randomized phase 3 trial that \nincluded 410 cancer survivors showed that a 4-week yoga therapy \nprogra m led to impro vements in fatigue and sleep quality and reductions in \ndaytime dysfunction .704 \nSurvivors at a higher risk of injury should be referred to a physical \ntherapist or exercise specialist (also see Healthy Lifestyles , above ). \nPsychosocial and Other Interventions  \nPsychosocial int erventions, such as CBT, MBSR, psycho -educational \ntherapy, and supportive expressive therapy, including support groups, \ncounseling, and journal writing (all category 1 recommendations), have \nalso been shown to reduce fatigue in cancer survivors, although d ata are \nnot entirely consistent.567,705 -710 Several meta -analyses have evaluated the \nrole of psychosocial interventions in reducing fatigue.700,705,709,711 For", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c159e368-f32a-4239-ad19-eb52486b0a6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c159e368-f32a-4239-ad19-eb52486b0a6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be14ef94-b7fb-48f3-9f41-59d264660b6d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "96e47c1d94e532c109cd98c9f907674466e966f85a059609160f6dd7f40a9cfb"}}, "hash": "96e47c1d94e532c109cd98c9f907674466e966f85a059609160f6dd7f40a9cfb", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-53 Gynecomastia  \nGynecomastia and breast pain can be treated in patients  on ADT b y \nprophylactic radiation (must be delivered prior to development of breast \ntissue), tamoxifen, or reduction mammoplasty.791,940,941  \nAnemia  \nAnemia in patients  on ADT is generally responsive to erythropoietin (EPO)  \nor blood transfusion. These individuals  can be treated as per the NCCN \nGuidelines for Cancer - and Chemotherapy -Induced Anemia (available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).  \nPain  \nMore than one -third of post -treatment cancer survivors experience chronic \npain, which often leads to psychological distress;  decreased activity, \nmotivation, and personal interactions; and an overall poor quality of life.942-\n946 Pain in survivors is often ineffectively managed. Barriers to optimal pain \nmanagement in cancer survivor s include health care providers\u2019 lack of \ntraining, fear of side effects and addiction, and reimbursement issues.947 \nPain has two predominant mechanisms: nociceptive and  neuropathic.948,949 \nInjury to somatic and visceral structures and the resulting activation of \nnociceptors present in skin, viscera, muscles, and connective tissues \ncause nociceptive pain. Somatic nociceptive pain is often d escribed as \nsharp, throbbing, or pressure -like, and often occurs after surgical \nprocedures. Visceral nociceptive pain is often diffuse and described as \naching or cramping.  Neuropathic pain is caused by injury to the peripheral \nnervous system or CNS  and might be described as numbness or as \nburning, sharp,  tingling, prickling, electrical,  or shooting  pain. Neuropathic \npain often occurs as a side  effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or \nis caused by  surgical injury to the nerves.  The incidence of  chronic pain after surgical treatment varies with the type \nof procedure and is as high as 60% in patients treated with breast surgery \nand 50% in those treated with lung surgery.942 Arthralgias, characterized \nby joint pain and stiffness, occur in roughly half of patients  taking \naromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.950 Pelvic pain \noften oc curs after pelvic radiation, resulting from fractures, fistulae, \nproctitis, cystitis, dyspareunia, or enteritis.942 \nThese NCCN Guidelin es for Survivorship make recommendations for the \nmanagement of seven categories of cancer pain syndromes: neuropathic \npain, chronic pain syndromes (ie, pain syndromes after amputation, neck \ndissection, mastectomy, thoracotomy), myalgias/arthralgias, skelet al pain, \nmyofascial pain, gastrointestinal/urinary/pelvic pain, and postradiation \npain. Recommendations for the p revention and management of  \nchemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in survivors can be \nfound in ASCO\u2019s clinical practice guideline .951 ASCO also has a clinical \npractice guideline  for the management of chronic pain in survivors of adult \ncancers.952  \nScreening for and Assessment of Pain  \nAll cancer  survivors  should be screened for pa in at regular intervals.  If \npain is present , the intensity should be quantified by the survivor. Because \npain is inherently subjective, self -report of pain is the current standard of \ncare for assessment. Intensity of pain should be quantified using a 0 to 10 \nnumeric rating scale, a categorical scale, or a pictorial scale (eg, Wong -\nBaker FACES  Pain Rating Scale ).953-956 In addition, the survivor should be \nasked to describe the characteristics of the pain ( eg, aching, burn ing). \nSevere uncontrolled pain is a medical emergency and should be \naddressed promptly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c93f7cb-027e-4328-97d9-8ea9cb10ed76": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c93f7cb-027e-4328-97d9-8ea9cb10ed76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "44c35445-9219-4406-86d9-9e975e408cce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "82696164c74a4394161bbc03efc5ba71a20677143c6e7d6c2ddd829d8ef07321"}}, "hash": "82696164c74a4394161bbc03efc5ba71a20677143c6e7d6c2ddd829d8ef07321", "text": "STANDARDS FOR SURVIVORSHIP CAREb\nCare of the cancer survivor should include:\n1.

These guidelines are focused on options to \nmaintain and enhan ce wellness in cancer survivors who are receiving or \nhave completed active therapy, including  those receiving treatment for \nyears, those who may be in remission, and those who are cured. These \nguidelines are designed to provide a framework for the manageme nt of \nlong-term and/or late effects of cancer and its treatment. T he guidelines \nfocus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment \nof cancer can have on the adult survivor's  health,  physical and mental  \nstates, health behaviors, professional and personal identity, sexuality , and \nfinancial standing . \nThe panel acknowledges  that there is a growing population of cancer \nsurvivors with chronic cancer. This group includes those with incurable \ndisease who are receiving  systemic therapy  continuously  and those  who \nmay be  on treatment  intermittently. Although these guidelines do not \naddress the specific needs of survivors with chronic cancer (eg, \npsychosocial issues related to living for years with a terminal diagnosis \nand u ncertainty about the future; how to handle comorbid conditions and \ndisease prevention, screening, and treatment in the setting of limited life \nexpectancy; managing discussions around new drugs and early -stage \nclinical trials ),15 many of the recommendations in these guidelines are relevant to this population (eg, those around fatigue, anxiety, depression ). \nThe panel emphasizes that these guidelines may be used to guide the \nmanagement of all cancer survivors \u2013 not just those who have completed \ntreatment, but also the population with chronic cancer.  \nThese guidelines  should be used as a supplement to the follow -up \nrecommendations within the disease -specific guidelines (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site, available at www.NCCN.org ) \nand should provide a framework for the coordination of care between the \nsurvivor\u2019s health care providers to ensure that needs are appropriately \naddressed.  \nThese guidelines are not intended to provide guidance for the care of \nsurvivors of childhood cancer (detailed guidelines for the care of childhood \ncancer survivors are available from the Children\u2019s Oncology Group at \nhttp://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/ ). For survivorship issues related to \nyounger populations,  please also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent \nand Young Adult  (AYA) Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org ). For \nsurvivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune -\nmediated toxicities is warranted (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nManagement of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nFor this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Surv ivorship, the panel \nfocused on the preventive health issues including healthy lifestyle \nbehaviors, immunizations and prevention of infection, and cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD) risk assessment and modification . The panel also focused \non several common issues  of survivors: 1) anthracycline -induced cardiac \ntoxicity; 2) anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress; 3) cognitive decline; \n4) fatigue; 5) lymphedema; 6) hormone -related symptoms; 7) pain; 8) \nfemale and male sexual dysfunction;  and 9)  sleep disorders.

work apply to survivors who are post active treatment as well as persons living \nchronically with cancer. However, discussions about work are ideally best had before treatment begins so that treatment recommendations \ncan take work needs into consideration if possible. \n\u2022 Symptoms affecting work may wax and wane with a survivor\u2019s treatments or disease status, especially if they are living chronically with \ncancer or the consequences of cancer treatment. Some survivors might start and stop working more than once.\n\u2022 Most existing literature focuses on unemployment and/or those who do not return to work. However, underemployment and/or work \nlimitations due to cancer or side effects are also common.\n\u2022 Employment helps to protect survivors from financial toxicity and, at least in the United States, is frequently tied to health insurance access. \nThis can be a main reason survivors work even when/if they are not fully recovered.\n\u2022 Employment is an important source of personal interaction, normalcy , and social support. The psychosocial effects/advantages derived from \nwork may include a sense of purpose, emotional well-being, link to identity , improved quality of life, connection with others, and distraction.\n\u2022 Some populations are at increased risk for difficulties related to work (based on factors such as gender , age, race, ethnicity, cancer type, \ncancer stage, rural residence, educational attainment, etc). The increased difficulties in these populations are more likely for survivors \nwith physically or cognitively demanding jobs or jobs with limited flexibility in scheduling or tasks. Additionally, patients with cancer may \nexperience discrimination as a result of diagnosis/illness, and this may be a consideration for some individuals in decisions surrounding \nemployment.\n\u2022 Survivors should be offered information to help them understand their likely ability to work, take into account their finances and personal/\nfamily needs, and discuss potential work accommodations with their employers.1 \n\u2022 Clinicians should regularly re-evaluate work-related concerns post active cancer treatment or for persons living chronically with cancer .\n\u0017Periodically identify goals and barriers regarding work with survivor  (SWORK-3).\n\u0017A team approach may be needed. Consider early involvement of social work, primary care, physical therapy/occupational therapy, cancer \nrehabilitation, and/or career counseling services, if available.\n\u0017Employment disability forms are not typically well-suited to cancer . However, clinicians should consider the survivor\u2019s needs for flexibility \nin tasks and hours, and other workplace accommodations as a starting point for filling out the necessary forms.

However, \nwhen compared with their pre -chemotherapy baseline, no differences \nwere noted among patients complaining of cognitive dysfunction. In \nanother study, cognitive function was compared among 196 long -term \nsurvivors of breast cancer treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, \nand fluorouracil (CMF) who were, on average, 21 years out from \ndiagnosis, an d 1509 control patients with no history of cancer.616 The \nchemotherapy group did significantly worse on several neuropsychological \ntests (eg, immediate and delayed verbal memory, executive functioning, \npsychomotor speed). Another study com pared 101 patients who \nunderwent an HSCT with 82 patients treated with a non -myeloablative \ntherapy; both groups showed mild cognitive impairments at baseline.617 \nAlthough no significant differences in cognitive dysfunction w ere identified \nat 2-year follow -up, patients who underwent HSCT had poorer \nperformances in several areas, including executive and psychomotor functions and  attention. More recent prospective, longitudinal studies have \nseen declines in neurocognitive or  neuropsychologic al test results in \nsurvivors of head and neck cancer (eg, in intellectual capacity, \nconcentration/short -term attention, verbal memory, executive function) and \nsurvivors with a history of hematopoietic cell transplantation  (HCT) (eg, in \nfine motor dexterity , verbal speed, processing speed, auditory memory,  \nexecutive function).618,619 \nThe correlation between patient reports of cognitive decline and results of \nneuropsychological testing has not been consistently demonstrated, \npossibly because of various definitions of cognitive dysfunction and \ndifferences in the  statistical analyses across studies.609 Other reasons for \nthe weak correlation between perceived and objective cognitive decline \nhave been proposed, including the fact that perceived cognitive decline is \ninfluenced by patient expectations whereas expectations do not affect \nobjec tive assessments and that objective assessments assess cognitive \nperformance under optimal rather than real -life conditions.620 However, \nsome studies have shown a strong correlation.",

Guidelines for Distress Management (available at www.NCCN. org) \ndefine as distress: \u201ca multifactorial unpleasant experience of a \npsychological (ie , cognitive, behavioral, emotional), social, spiritual, and/or \nphysical nature that may interfere with one\u2019s ability to cope effectively with \ncancer, its physical symptoms, and its treatment.\u201d Distress, often related to \nfear of recurrence, is common in sur vivors and can negatively impact \nquality of life.19,69,510 -512 Survivors with untreated, uncontrolled emotional \ndistress are less likely to adhere to recommended surveillance and are \nless likely t o engage in health -promoting activities, such as exercise and \nsmoking cessation.120 Sometimes these individuals develop thoughts of  \nending their lives; the incidence of  completed suicide among patients with \ncancer and survivors in the United States is about twice that of the general \npopulation.513-518 \nRisk factors for psychosocial distress in cancer survivors include \npersistent problems with physical health ; enduring  physical signs  of \ncancer/ negative body image ; a tendency toward s self-criticism; n on-white \nrace; low educational, financial, or social support; f inancial concerns ; \nbeing u nmarried ; and  having survived m ultiple primary cancers .519 \nFear of recurrence, with persisting worry and distress  sometimes reaching \nlevels of clinical anxiety, is common, occurring in up to 80% of cancer \nsurvivors.519 This fear can increase at times of routine cancer surveillance \ntesting or with p hysical symptoms that may or may not be related to the \ncancer diagnosis.19,69,510 -512,520 Anxiety and/or depression can also occur in \nsurvivors secondary to physical  compromise, social  isolation, or work and \nfinancial problems that result from cancer treatment.66,69,73,512,521 These \nchallenges are accentuated by the usual decreased medical and  \ninterpersonal support following completion of treatment and transition to \nthe surveillance phase of care.179  \nAnxiety and/or depression affect up to 29% of survivors.66,69,74 -76,522,523 \nStudies also show that 17% to 38% of survivors have PTSD symptoms while 5% to 12% meet full criteria, and symptoms do not resolve with time  \nfor many survivors.519 A meta -analysis determined the log odds ratio for a \nPTSD diagnosis in cancer survivors compared with non -cancer controls to \nbe 1.66 (95% CI,  1.09\u20132.53).524 In one longitudinal study, 12% of survivors \nreported that their PTSD symptoms resolved  over 5 years, whereas 37% \nreported that their symp toms persisted or worsened during that time.75 \nAnother study found that 22% of survivors had PTSD symptoms at 6 \nmonths, and 6% had such symptoms at 4 years.525 PTSD symptoms in \nsurvivors can fluctuate over time, because of other events or trauma \noccurring in the survivor\u2019s life.  \nThe panel\u2019s recommendations for the ma nagement of anxiety,

It is often \nsimply called heart disease. Some types of \ncardiovascular disease are listed in Guide 4 .\nCardiovascular disease causes the most \ndeaths around the world. It can cause disabling \nand fatal events.\n \u0086Heart attack (myocardial infarction)\n \u0086Stroke (cerebrovascular accident) \n \u0086Blocked blood vessel (embolism)\nCancer survivors are more likely to develop \nheart disease than people who never have \nhad cancer. Cardiovascular disease causes \nmore deaths among survivors than many types \nof cancer. Some of the causes of cancer can \nalso cause cardiovascular disease. Some \ncancer treatments increase the chance of \ncardiovascular disease.\n \u0086Chemotherapy such as anthracyclines\n \u0086Targeted therapy such as HER2-targeted \ntherapy\n \u0086Hormone therapy such as androgen \ndeprivation therapy (ADT)\n \u0086Radiation therapy delivered near the heart\n \u0086Immunotherapy such as immune \ncheckpoint inhibitorsThe onset of cardiovascular disease varies \namong cancer survivors. Except for radiation, \ncardiovascular disease that is related to \ncancer treatment starts during or shortly after \ntherapy. Radiation-related cardiovascular \ndisease may occur years after treatment ends. \nCardiovascular disease that is not related to \ncancer treatment most often develops 5 or \nmore years after diagnosis.

If detected \nearly, treatment for a late effect may reduce its \nimpact on your life.\nCancer surveillance\nCancer that was thought to be cured can \nreappear on tests. The return of cancer is \ncalled a recurrence or relapse. Survivorship \ncare includes routine checking for a recurrence. \nThis is called surveillance. Surveillance often \nincludes updating your health history and a \nphysical exam. Some survivors get blood tests \nor imaging like x-rays or scans.\nScreening for cancer\nCancer screening is routine testing of cancer \nor pre-cancer conditions. The aim is to detect \ncancer at an early stage when treatment works \nbest. There is screening for prostate, breast, \ncervical, skin, lung, and colorectal cancers. \nScreening is started when there is an average \nor high risk of cancer. Ask your health care \nprovider what screening, if any, you need.\nSurvivors have a higher risk of a new (second) \ncancer. Ask your health care provider about \nyour chance of getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some causes of a first cancer may be \nrelated to getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some cancer treatments may increase \ncancer risk. Such treatments include \nradiation therapy, certain chemotherapies, \nand certain targeted therapies. \u0086Excess radiation from a lifetime of \ncomputed tomography (CT) scans slightly \nincreases cancer risk. Ask your provider if \nthese scans are needed and for how long.\nSome survivors are at risk of hereditary \ncancers. Hereditary cancer is caused by \nabnormal genes that are passed down from \nparents to children. Cancers that can be \nhereditary include breast, ovarian, colorectal, \nand prostate cancer.\nAt health visits, update your health care \nproviders on any new cancers among your \nblood relatives. Your provider may suggest \ngetting genetic testing. A blood sample is \nneeded. You may talk with a genetic counselor \nto discuss your family\u2019s cancer history.\nLate effects\nMany effects of treatment quickly resolve \nafter treatment ends. An example is nausea \nand vomiting. Long-term effects start during \ntreatment and persist after treatment is done. \nLess often, effects start long after treatment \nhas ended. During health visits, your health \ncare providers will assess for such late effects. \nThey will provide treatment for late or long-term \neffects as needed.\nCoordinated care\nCancer survivors often receive care from \nmultiple providers. You may receive care from \noncologists, a primary care provider, and non-\ncancer specialists. Your providers will work \ntogether and clarify their roles to address all \nyour needs. Over time, your primary care \nprovider will resume charge over your health \ncare.

This increased risk is due to genetic susceptibilities (eg, \nhereditary cancer syndromes) and/or family history, shared etiologic exposures (eg, smoking, environmental exposures, health behaviors, \nhuman papillomavirus [HPV]), and mutagenic effects of cancer treatment. Health behaviors should be modified as possible (eg, smoking \ncessation, weight management) to decrease the risk of subsequent malignancies.\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyle and behavioral counseling are important to reduce risk factors that may contribute to subsequent cancers (HL-1).\n\u2022 Treatment-related subsequent primary cancers vary with the type and intensity of anticancer treatment and are associated in particular with \nRT and specific chemotherapeutic agents. For recommendations for screening considerations, s ee Principles of Screening for Treatment-\nRelated Subsequent Primary Cancers (SURV-C).\n\u2022 Screening for subsequent primary cancers should be a shared responsibility between primary and oncology care physicians. For survivors \nliving with metastatic disease, recommendations for screening should be tailored to the survivor's individualized risk and disease status.  \n(See the NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, and Risk Reduction  ). \n\u2022 Evidence suggests that excess lifetime radiation exposure from CT imaging may be associated with a mildly increased risk of developing a \nradiation-associated cancer. Use of radiologic studies to screen for recurrent cancer should be based on diagnosis and evidence that early \ndetection of recurrence will improve cancer-related outcomes. Recommendations for surveillance imaging modality and frequency can be \nfound in the NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site.\n\u2022 For familial assessment considerations that impact screening, see SURV-5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9247458b-145e-4ac7-bd6f-aba436f72ba0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9247458b-145e-4ac7-bd6f-aba436f72ba0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de34ed80-1426-4c74-b5a6-878455504855", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "b4e13d16a50f5cdc313c3145514d8fccf948d6465686a0c8eb6f0da5ce9f5a98"}}, "hash": "b4e13d16a50f5cdc313c3145514d8fccf948d6465686a0c8eb6f0da5ce9f5a98", "text": ".\n\n\nLATE EFFECTS/LONG-TERM PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL PROBLEMS\nLymphedema\nSLYMPH-2 \n\u2022 Principles of Lymphedema\n\u00171st bullet revised: \"...acute or chronic condition.

However , many cancer survivors report that fatigue may be a \ndisruptive symptom months or years after treatment ends.\n\u0017Fatigue that initially presents months after the completion of adjuvant therapy or fatigue that worsens over this period warrants additional \nevaluation.\n\u2022 Fatigue is a subjective experience that should be systematically assessed using patient self-reports and other sources of data for cancer \nsurvivors in the months and years after diagnosis.\n\u2022 Patients and family/caregiver(s) should be informed that management of fatigue is an integral part of total health care and that fatigue can \npersist following treatment.\n\u2022 Medical care contracts should include reimbursement for the management of fatigue.\n\u2022 Disability insurance should include coverage for the continuing effects of fatigue.\n\u2022  Referral to rehabilitation services including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and physical medicine should be considered for \nsurvivors with fatigue in the months and years after cancer diagnosis.\n\u2022 Also see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4828f3e3-9006-4ee9-8275-42d28d457414": {"__data__": {"id_": "4828f3e3-9006-4ee9-8275-42d28d457414", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06e42cff-9cf2-498f-851b-d90a7cccd003", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "5825308e646cd447b67071c253ae491b8c5495c883881100d4280904a4efd528"}}, "hash": "5825308e646cd447b67071c253ae491b8c5495c883881100d4280904a4efd528", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Employment and Return to Work\n\n\nSURVIVOR/FAMILY EDUCATION AND COUNSELING OTHER INTERVENTIONS\n\u2022 Help survivor identify goals with regards to \nworking and barriers to those goals\n\u2022 Discuss coping strategies for the psychosocial \nimpacts of cancer and cancer treatment\n\u2022 Provide guidance about expected duration/\nmanagement of symptoms or comorbidities \nlimiting employment and return to work\n\u2022 Recommend that survivors find out about their \nemployer's Human Resources (HR) policies\n\u2022 Provide resources to understand options and \ncommunicate with employer  \n(SURV-B page 2 of 5)\n\u0017Include community-based, national, and online \ncareer counseling resources\u2022 Refer as appropriate:\n\u0017Vocational/occupational rehabilitation specialist\n\u0017Physical or occupational therapist\n\u0017Psychologist\n\u0017State vocational rehabilitative services\n\u0017Neuropsychology evaluation\n\u0017Social worker\n\u0017Financial counselor\n\u0017Patient navigator\n\u2022 Pharmacologic intervention for underlying causal \nsymptom(s) as indicated (SWORK-2)Periodic  \nre-evaluation\n(SWORK-2)ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS\nSWORK-3", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15029bdf-1e75-4ef2-9130-7fd30521a037": {"__data__": {"id_": "15029bdf-1e75-4ef2-9130-7fd30521a037", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02aeacd1-4093-41f4-b33d-495c35c76525", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "a07f869cbe2cb1e13954fa44c7ea40eb44ccc1f58b2fa666eaf703ebe35ce369"}}, "hash": "a07f869cbe2cb1e13954fa44c7ea40eb44ccc1f58b2fa666eaf703ebe35ce369", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Distress \n\n\nSANXDE-1GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, TRAUMA, AND DISTRESS\na Lu D, Andersson TM, Fall K, et al. Clinical diagnosis of mental disorders immediately before and after cancer diagnosis: a nationwide matched cohort study in Sweden. \nJAMA Oncol 2016;1188-1196.\u2022 The NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management define distress as \u201ca multifactorial unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (ie, \ncognitive, behavioral, emotional), social, spiritual, and/or physical nature that may interfere with the ability to cope effectively with cancer , its \nphysical symptoms, and its treatment.\u201d The NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship complement the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management.\n\u2022 Survivors of cancer and its treatment are at elevated risk for mental health issues such as fear of recurrence, distress, anxiety , and \ndepression that may persist for many years after diagnosis.a\n\u0017Fear of recurrence can lead to increased symptoms when surveillance testing or follow-up appointments are scheduled and increased \nanxiety when physical symptoms occur that may or may not be similar to those experienced during the cancer diagnosis. \n\u0017Medical, psychosocial, environmental, and psychiatric health factors may affect the mood of cancer survivors and need to be considered \nwhen screening for distress, anxiety, and depression in survivors and deciding on treatment (SANXDE-6) . \n\u0017Recurrent worry, fear, thoughts, or images related to cancer events should be distinguished from obsessive compulsive disorders.  \nRepetitive, persisting thoughts, images, or behaviors or mental acts that a person is compelled to perform, aimed at reducing intense \nanxiety or preventing a dreaded event require psychiatric referral for evaluation and treatment.\n\u0017Monitor distress, especially at times of new diagnoses, transitions in care, cancer surveillance, significant loss, other major life events, and \nwith social isolation.\n \u25caSurvivors may not appear to be distressed and should be encouraged to inform their health care provider when they are feeling \nincreased distress, worry, anxiety, or depression. See NCCN Distress Thermometer Screening Tool (DIS-A)\n \u25caScreening for anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress should be a part of routine care. The panel recommends using validated \nmeasures such as the PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, PC-PTSD-5 for trauma (also see Trauma Screening [SANXDE-D] ), NCCN \nDistress Thermometer Screening Tool (DIS-A) , or PROMIS measures. \n\u0017Clinical assessments should include and evaluate psychosocial aspects of a survivor's background, including trauma (SANXDE-7) .\n\u0017Caregivers and all family members of the survivor, including younger children, are vulnerable to the same psychosocial stresses and \nsymptoms as survivors, though often at different times or for different reasons. If needs are observed, they can be offered resources and \nreferred for evaluation.\n\u2022 This algorithm is intended for oncologists and other health care providers to screen for distress, anxiety, and depression in cancer \nsurvivors, to provide steps for addressing these concerns with survivors, and to facilitate decisions about referral to specialists. \n\u0017The algorithm is not intended as a psychiatric diagnosis and treatment tool.\n\u0017The algorithm focuses on more common mood disorders after cancer. It does not screen or address treatment for psychiatric conditions \nsuch as bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, personality disorders, or obsessive compulsive disorders. Diagnosis and management of these \ndisorders should be done by a mental health professional (NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management).\n\u2022 Decisions about treatment and referral will depend on the acuteness of onset of symptoms, their intensity, and safety of the survivor and \nothers (SANXDE-6  and SANXDE-A ).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea362686-c2a4-4145-99a1-1fda64e02fa9": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea362686-c2a4-4145-99a1-1fda64e02fa9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b1f96bfb-e53d-46b2-99c3-8cb8a52f4069", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "a03b6a81e666ee08439a7da78bfc6f00f1c0cf14da95cb23ac0e372244b3ecdf"}}, "hash": "a03b6a81e666ee08439a7da78bfc6f00f1c0cf14da95cb23ac0e372244b3ecdf", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-35 Other alternative treatments (eg, yoga, tai chi, mindfulness) may also be \nhelpful to survivors suffering from distress, although data showing their \neffectiveness are limited.558-562 Mindfulness is possibly the best -studied \nalternative treatment for psychological problems in cancer survivors.563-567 \nFor example, a random ized controlled trial of 322 survivors of breast \ncancer found that a 6 -week m indfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) \nprogram reduced anxiety and fear of recurrence and also improved \nfatigue.567 In non -cancer settings, weight loss interventions have improved \ndepression in obese individuals,568 although evidence in cancer or survivor \npopulations is lacking.  \nPharmacolo gic Treatments  \nCancer survivors use medication for anxiety and depression at a rate \nabout twice that of the general population.569 A population -based study in \nCanada found that 44% of cancer survivors were using an anxiolytic, and \n22% were using an antidepressant.570 Antidepressants and antianxiety \ndrugs have been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of depression \nand anxiety in patients with cancer.571-578 Evidence of these effects is \nlacking in cancer survivors, although these drugs have been studied in this \npopulation f or their effects on vasomotor symptoms (see Hormone -\nRelated Symptoms ). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and \nserotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can therefore be \nused in s urvivors with moderate - to severe -intensity major depr ession, \ngeneralized anxiety, panic , or PTSD . SNRIs should be considered for \nconcomitant pain or concomitant hot flashes (also see Hormone -Related \nSymptoms ). Psychotropics with cytochrome P450 interactions (ie, \nfluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion,  fluvoxamine , nefazodone , \nduloxetine, clomipramine ) should be used with caution in survivors taking \ntamoxifen. Pure SSRIs, and in particular paroxetine, block conversion of \ntamoxifen to active metabolites through CYP2D6 and should be used with \ncaution for patients  on tamoxifen (see Hormone -Related Symptoms  for a \ndiscussion of psychotropics and cytochrome P450 interactions).579-581 Survivors should be counseled that it may take up to 2 to 6 weeks at a \nthera peutic dose for SSRIs and SNRIs to take effect, and that a trial of \nseveral different drugs may be needed to find the best option for an \nindividual. BZDs (ie, clonazepam, lorazepam) can be used for acute \nanxiety relief or while waiting for antidepressants to take effect. The BZD \ndose should be adjusted once SSRIs or SNRIs are fully effective and \nsymptoms are partially or completely abated. Survivors should also be \ncounseled that symptoms of withdrawal may occur should any of the \nabove -mentioned medications be abruptly discontinued.  Referral to a \nmental health professional should be considered if the response to first -\nline treatment  is inadequate.  \nCognitive Dysfunction  \nCognitive impairment is a common complaint among cancer survivors and \nmay be a consequence of the tumors themselves or of the direct effects of \ncancer -related treatment (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy). This \nsymptom may be especially prominent in survivors of primary central \nnervous system (CNS) cancers or those with brain metas tases, but \nsurvivors who never had brain involvement may also report difficulties in \ncognition.582 For some survivors, symptoms persist long -term.583 When \nsevere, the presence of cognitive dysfunction can impact quali ty of life and \nfunction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4974303-2f02-4a12-a646-66a3cfe06ae2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4974303-2f02-4a12-a646-66a3cfe06ae2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac3b3889-111e-4204-8d16-aa2878fc3e1b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "8824cc562ed4814498cc86c5814e902d417010da27030cbb15a125382b322f5d"}}, "hash": "8824cc562ed4814498cc86c5814e902d417010da27030cbb15a125382b322f5d", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Healthy Lifestyles\n\n\nHL-1GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLES\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyle habits have been associated with improved overall health and quality of life.

CVD-related comorbidity and mortality may detrimentally affect patients with \ncancer and survivors with short- and long-term sequelae. Counseling regarding cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle modifications are \nparamount in cancer survivors and patients with favorable prognoses. The risk of CVD-related death varies with years from diagnosis, with \nmost survivors being at greatest risk 5 or more years after diagnosis and completion of curative therapy.\n\u2022 Referral to a cardiologist or cardio-oncologist in patients at elevated CVD risk should be considered at any stage of the cancer journey .\n\u2022 Shared risk factors for both cancer and CVD (ie, smoking, poor health behaviors) contribute to the development of CVD and structural heart \ndisease or heart failure, a concept that becomes especially relevant to cancer survivors. Attention and counseling regarding shared risk \nfactors may improve cancer- and cardiovascular-related outcomes.\n\u2022 Cancer treatments (immunotherapy,a cytotoxic and targeted systemic therapies,b RT) can result in diverse cardiovascular issues, including \ncardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis after head and neck and mantle \nradiation, and cerebrovascular accidents.\n\u0017Survivors treated with anthracyclines are at increased risk for heart failure (SCARDIO-1).\n\u0017Androgen or estrogen deprivation therapy may elevate cardiovascular risk.c\n\u2022 Most CVDs (such as atherosclerosis) develop over time as a result of well-defined risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, use of \ntobacco products, obesity, and diabetes. Control of these risk factors can decrease the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. \n\u2022 Survivors should be assessed throughout the survivorship continuum for:\n\u0017Pre-existing and emerging CVD (eg, CAD, CHF, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation) and CVD risk factors \n(eg, hypertension, dislipidemia, obesity, cigarette/tobacco use, diabetes mellitus), with intervention for modifiable risk factors as necessary\n\u0017Cancer treatment history (eg, regimen/dose,b radiation field, dose/volume)\n\u0017Diet and exercise habits\n\u2022 Tools exist to help quantify atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk (eg, ASCVD risk scored).\n\u2022 Survivors should be counseled on any increased risk of CVD they may have based on prior treatment, comorbidity, or CVD risk factors and \non the ABCDEs of CVD Prevention (see Table 1 on SCVD-2).\n\u2022 Cooperation and shared care with primary care providers, and cardiovascular specialists as needed, is key to optimizing cardiac and \nvascular outcomes in cancer survivors. \n\u2022 Consider referral to cardio-oncology or a cardiology specialist for high-risk survivors.e\na Drobni ZD, Alvi RM, Taron J, et al.

\nThe number of cancer survivors in the United States increased from \napproximately 3 million in 1971 to more than 16.9 million  in 2019.1-3 This \nnumber is predicted to surpass 22 million by 2030.3 This striking increase \nis generally attributed to rising cancer incidence rates (mainly resulting \nfrom an aging population), earlier detection, a nd better treatment.  \nApproximately  64% of survivors were  65 years of age or older in 2019 .3 \nOnly 5% are younger than 40 years, and survivors of childhood cancer \nconstitute between 0.5% and 3.0% of the survivor population.4,5 In fact, an \nestimated 1 of every 5 persons older than 65 years is a can cer survivor.  \nThe most common cancer sites in the survivor population are breast, \nprostate, colon/rectum, and melanoma, together accounting for \napproximately 58% of survivors.4 Approximately 64% of survivors were \ndiagnosed 5 or more years ago, whereas 15% of survivors were \ndiagnosed 20 or more years ago, and approximately 5% have survived 30 \nyears or longer.4 \nUnfortu nately, many of these cancer survivors experience physical and/or \npsychosocial late and/or long -term effects of cancer and its treatment, \nwhich can be severe, debilitating, and sometimes permanent. Survivors \nmay be discharged from the care of their oncolog ist and feel isolated and \nscared. Furthermore, their primary care physicians (PCPs), who may now \nbe responsible for their care, often do not know how best to care for the \nspecific concerns and needs of cancer survivors.6 ASCO\u2019s statement, \n\u201cAchieving High -Quality Cancer Survivorship Care,\u201d cites a need for \nstandardized, evidence -based practice guidelines for the management of \ntreatment effects and heal th promotion of survivors.7 ASCO, NCCN, ACS, \nand other groups that are working in parallel hope to provide this \nguidance.8-12 The NCCN S urvivorship  Panel is comprised of a multidisciplinary panel of \nexperts  that includes at least one oncologist, bone marrow transplant \nclinician , gynecologist, urologist, infectious disease specialist , cardiologist, \nPCP, psychologist, nutrition scientist, nurse , epidemi ologist, social worker, \nand patient advocate.

Studies have reported elevated levels of \ncytokines or DNA damage as some of the possible mechanisms.622 \nStructural studies have supported the hypothesis that neurotoxicity \nresulting in damage to white matter of the brain may play an important role \nin cognitive deficits after chemotherapy treatment,583,586,599,623,624 and \nfunctional MRI studies show that changes in brain activity accompany \ncognitive complaints or cognitive deficits in survivors.624-626 In addition, \ninsomnia, fatigue, and depression, common in cancer survivors, may \nnegatively influence cognitive function, although several studies have \nfound that cognitive dysfunction does not correlate with mood.616,627,628 \nPsychosomati c effects can also contribute, as evidenced by a study of \npatients to be treated with chemotherapy that found that those who were \ninformed of the possible cognitive side effects were more likely to report \ncognitive dysfunction and perform worse on neuropsy chological testing \nthan uninformed patients.629 A better und erstanding of the mechanisms \nthat cause cancer -related cognitive impairment is essential for the \ndevelopment of treatments to improve cognitive function and quality of life \nin patients with cancer and survivors.582,630,631 \nIn October 2006, the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force \n(ICCTF)  was formed, comprising a multidisciplinary group of health \nprofessionals and health advocates. The mission of ICCTF is to advance \nunderstanding of the impact of cancer and cancer -related treatment on \ncognitive and behavioral functioning in patients with C NS and non -CNS \ncancers.632 The group published recommendations regarding \nneuropsychological testing, defining cognitive impairment /changes, \nneuroimaging, and future study design.631,633 \nThese NCCN Guidelines address cognitive function of survivors with non -\nCNS malignancies who did not have CNS -directed therapies.  Assessment and Evaluation for Cognitive Dysfunction  \nPatients who report cognitive impairment should be screened for \npotentially reversible factors that may contribute to cognitive impairment, \nincluding depression, pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Some  \nmedications can also contribute to cognitive impairment. Therefore, \ncurrent medications, including over -the-counter medications and \nsupplements, should be reviewed.  \nFor those who present with concomitant focal neurologic deficits and those \nwhose symptoms  evolve to include these findings, imaging is indicated to \nrule out structural abnormalities  (ie, brain or CNS disease). In addition, \nimaging in the absence of focal findings may be appropriate for patients \ndeemed to be at high risk for recurrence or metas tatic disease involving \nthe CNS.  \nUnfortunately, no effective brief screening tool for cancer -associated \ncognitive dysfunction in the asymptomatic cancer survivor currently exists. \nThe Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE634) and similar screening tools \nlack adequate sensitivity  to detect the subtle decline in cognitive \nperformance seen in most cancer survivors. Instead, the panel listed \nseveral questions that can help clarify the nature of the impairment, \nincluding inquiries about the ability to pay attention, find words, rememb er \nthings, think clearly, and perform functions. The time of onset of symptoms \nand the trajectory over time should also be assessed.  \nManagement of Cognitive Dysfunction  \nSurvivors benefit from validation of their symptom experience and should \nbe reassured t hat, in most survivors, cognitive dysfunction does not \nworsen over time. In fact, data from breast cancer survivors suggest that \nsymptoms may improve over time.585 The panel recommends the use of \nnonpharmacologic interventions whenever possible, with pharmacologic \ninterventions as a last line of therapy in survivors for whom other \ninterventions have been insufficient, as discussed in the following", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61144881-f87f-4bcb-974e-d1b225d6175a": {"__data__": {"id_": "61144881-f87f-4bcb-974e-d1b225d6175a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0613b93-13d7-4058-8fac-647c32c87474", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "60f1be6ac8f310e24c278896e6a28159b66bef91e317ce58e42dab122731e470"}, "3": {"node_id": "db175b80-1901-4979-adfc-fa991ebaa8cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "841bdf48a2a8659b8348f81a9b358d52fde0bbeb21a27a689a79e5f6978c9dba"}}, "hash": "6df7b5e5bede09b6c7c1450843264f18b6672adeebea223ada64de45bce1516f", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-29 Assessment of Comorbidit ies and Cardiovascular Risk Factors  \nThe panel recommends assessment of comorbidities and other traditional \nrisk factors for heart disease  (see Cardiovascular Disease Risk \nAssessment , above) . Furthermore, the oncologic history of the survivor \nshould be revi ewed. Chest radiation can increase the risk of ischemic \ncardiac disease, which can contribute to heart failure.436,442,448,495 The \naddition of other cardiotoxic therapies (eg, HER2 -targeted agents) to \nanthracyclines can further incr ease the risk of heart failure over that seen \nwith the use of anthracyclines alone.496 Older survivors, those w ith a \nhigher cumulative anthracycline dose  (cumulative doxorubicin dose of 250 \nmg/m2 or equivalent497), those with underlying CVD  or risk factors, and \nthose who had a low -normal (50% \u201354%) baseline ejection fraction are \nalso at increased risk for the development of heart failure. Recent data \nalso showed that being o verweight or obes e and v isceral and \nintramuscular adiposity  are risk factors  for cardiotoxi city from \nanthracyclines  in breast cancer survivors.498,499 In addition, the risk of \ncardiac events and death  in survivors of breast cancer has been shown to \nincrease as the number of cardiovascular risk factors increases.500  \nImaging  \nWhen developing these imaging guidelines for screening for cardiac \ntoxicity in survivors with a history of anthracycline exposure, the panel \nconsidered several questions: 1) Is the prevalence of structural heart \ndisease h igh enough to warrant screening of anthracycline -treated \nsurvivors ?; 2) Is an abnormal echocardiogram post -anthracycline therapy \nassociated with  an increased risk  for the future development of \nsymptomatic heart failure ?; and 3) Does the recognition of  cardiac \nabnormalities  and treatment  of cardiac risk factors  post-anthracycline \ntherapy  affect outcomes ? \nAs for the prevalence of structural heart disease in patients treated with \nanthracyclines, a  study of 2625 patients with cancer (mostly breast cancer or non -Hodgkin lymphoma) assessed LVEF be fore, every 3 months during \nanthracycline chemotherapy and during the following year, every 6 months \nfor the next 4 years, and annual after that.464 Cardiotoxicity, defined as \nLVEF  <50%  and decreas ed by >10 absolute points, was observed in 9% \nof the study population. In the large randomized controlled NSABP B -31 \ntrial, cardiac function was assessed by cardiac imaging in patients after \ninitial anthracycline -based therapy as a requirement for further treatment \nwith trastuzumab.501 Over 7% of patients experienced cardiac symptoms \nand/or a decrease in LVEF of >15% after receiving anthracyclines, thus \nexcluding them from being considered for trastuzumab. It is important to \nnote that this was a clinical trial patient population without significant \ncardiac risk factors or history of cardiac disease. In a non -clinical trial \npopulation of patients with cancer, many may already have cardiac risk \nfactors or actual cardiomyopathy pr ior to treatment, thus elevating the risk \nof developing heart failure. Together, these results indicate that a \nsignificant proportion of survivors with early -onset Stage B or greater heart \nfailure can be identified with appropriate imaging after therapy. H owever, it \nis not clear that these declines in LVEF after anthracycline therapy were \nassociated with an increased risk of developing subsequent heart failure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db175b80-1901-4979-adfc-fa991ebaa8cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "db175b80-1901-4979-adfc-fa991ebaa8cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0613b93-13d7-4058-8fac-647c32c87474", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "60f1be6ac8f310e24c278896e6a28159b66bef91e317ce58e42dab122731e470"}, "2": {"node_id": "61144881-f87f-4bcb-974e-d1b225d6175a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "6df7b5e5bede09b6c7c1450843264f18b6672adeebea223ada64de45bce1516f"}}, "hash": "841bdf48a2a8659b8348f81a9b358d52fde0bbeb21a27a689a79e5f6978c9dba", "text": "Regarding the second question, little is known regarding the natural \nhistory of heart failure in survivors with  Stage B heart failure  post-\nanthracycline therapy , and  the long -term prognosis of survivors with \ncardiac structural abnormalities following anthracycline exposure is not \nknown .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d5aff46-26b7-474d-83a3-5e7ee9bd4c2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d5aff46-26b7-474d-83a3-5e7ee9bd4c2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c5c360a9-0bc8-41c1-9b27-d39c0b0c0556", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "5b7e74023cce1d8bef93e04291af520b5ed491dd3fc33b6639cdcabffc1971ed"}}, "hash": "5b7e74023cce1d8bef93e04291af520b5ed491dd3fc33b6639cdcabffc1971ed", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-7 Standards for Survivorship Care  \nIn 2005, the  Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now known as the National \nAcademy of  Medicine [NAM]) and the National Research Council compiled \na report  entitled , \u201cFrom Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in \nTransition. \u201d28 The NCCN Survivorship Panel adapted  the essential \ncomponents of survivorship care from the report:  \n1. Prevention of new and recurrent  cancers and other late effects  \n2. Surveillance for cancer spread , recurrence, or subsequent cancers  \n3. Assessment of late psychosocial , physical , and immunologic \neffects   \n4. Intervention for consequences of cancer and treatment ( eg, \nmedical problems, symptoms, psy chologic distress,  financial and \nsocial concerns)  \n5. Coordination of care between primary care providers and \nspecialists to ensure that all of the survivor\u2019s health needs are met  \n6.

These skills include learning, \nreasoning, memory, problem solving, and \ndecision-making. Cognitive dysfunction is an \nimpairment of one or more thinking skills.\nMany cancer survivors report having some \ndegree of cognitive dysfunction. Common \nproblems occur with memory, attention, \nplanning, processing, and learning. Cognitive \ndysfunction may be caused by cancer and its \ntreatment. It may be more severe when cancer \nstarts in or spreads to the brain. \nCognitive dysfunction most commonly \noccurs after chemotherapy. When related to \nchemotherapy, it is often called \u201cchemobrain.\u201d \nThe causes of chemobrain are not well \nunderstood. Other cancer treatments that may \ncause cognitive dysfunction include endocrine \ntherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. \nCognitive dysfunction differs between cancer \nsurvivors. The type of problem varies. Problems \ncan be long-term or short lived. Most survivors \ndo not have severe problems but some do. \nWhen severe, cognitive dysfunction can impact \nquality of life and ability to work.Assessment\nAt this time, there isn\u2019t one good screening tool \nof cancer-related cognitive dysfunction. To get \nhelp, tell your health care provider about any \ncognitive problems you have. Ask family or \nfriends to share what they have observed.

Anticancer \ntreatment modalities used in a variety of cancers have the potential to \ndamage blood vessels, leading to a reduction in blood circulation to the \npenis and/or damage to the autonomic nervous system. Thus, higher rates \nof ED are seen in cancer su rvivors than in the general population. The \nprevalence of ED in male survivors of colorectal cancer has been reported \nto range from 45% to 75%,1042,1073,1074 and it has been reported in up to \n90% of survivors of prostate cancer.1075 -1079   \nMale cancer survivors exposed to radiation or chemotherapy often \nexperience hypogonadism \u2014usually primary hypogonadism. \nHypogonadism refers to a decrease i n the production of sperm and/or \ntestosterone. Primary hypogonadism is the result of testicular failure ; \ntestosterone levels and sperm counts are below normal, and serum LH \nand FSH are above normal. Secondary hypogonadism is a disease of the \npituitary or hypothalamus. In survivors  with secondary hypogonadism, \nserum testosterone levels and sperm counts are subnormal, and the \nserum LH and FSH levels are normal or reduced. Adult -onset \nhypogonadism is characterized by a deficiency of testosterone and a \nfailure of the body to produce an adequate compensatory response. In \nthese individuals , low testosterone levels are associated with normal or \nlow levels of gonadotropins, suggesting physiologic failure of both the \ntesticles and hypothalamic -pituitary system.1080 Evaluation and Assessment for Sexual Function  \nAll adult cancer survivors, regardless of gender identity and sexual \norientation, should be ask ed about their sexual function at regular \nintervals, by inquiring about any concerns or distress regarding sexual \nfunction, sexual activity, sexual relationships, or sex life . Cancer survivors \nwho report distress should be evaluated further. Inquiries into  treatment -\nrelated infertility should be made if indicated, with referrals as appropriate. \nASCO\u2019s recently updated clinical practice guidelines on  fertility \npreservation for patients with cancer  have more information on the \ntopic.1081 It is important for providers to be aware that fertility issues should \nbe addressed in the survivorship phase, whether or not they were \naddressed prior to treatment.1082 -1084 A discussion regarding the need for \ncontraception may also be helpful in some cases, because the incidence \nof unplanned pregnancies is approximately three  times higher in cancer \nsurvivors than in the general population.1085 \nSurvivors for whom screening does not indicate an issue with sexual \nfunction shou ld be rescreened at subsequent visits. For survivors with \nsexual function concerns who do not wish to discuss them at the current \nvisit, referral can be made to a sexual health specialist if the survivor is \ninterested. These survivors should also be re -evaluated and engaged in \ndiscussions about the potential impact of treatment on sexual function  at \nfuture visits . \nFor survivors who want to discuss their sexual function further, screening \ntools can be considered.

Mild distress may reduce quality of \nlife. Severe distress can affect a person\u2019s self-\ncare, social life, mood, or faith. Survivors with \nsevere distress may not go to health visits or \nhave a healthy lifestyle.\nDistress can lead to or worsen mental \ndisorders. Mental disorders are health \nconditions just like heart disease is a health \ncondition. There are many types of mental \ndisorders. Each mental disorder is a group of \nsymptoms that are related to major problems \nwith emotion, thinking, or behavior.

Ongoing screening is important. \nMental health issues can start any time after a \ncancer diagnosis. Also, your provider may not \nknow you\u2019re struggling unless you very clearly \nsay so.\nDistress can occur at any point in time, but \nthere are times when distress is more likely. \nDistress is likely during routine health care \nvisits, when getting health tests, or when \nsymptoms occur.

High levels of distress, \npain, sleepiness, or fatigue reduce sexual \ndesire and arousal. After a cancer diagnosis, \nmental health and relationships may decline \nand impact sexual functioning. You may want \nto avoid sexual activity because you do not like \nyour body.\nAssessment and referral\nYour health care providers will ask about your \nsexual functioning. Don\u2019t be shy to share any \nconcerns or problems. If you are younger, \nyour provider will also talk to you about having \nchildren and birth control.\nYour health care provider may ask you to \ncomplete a short survey. Surveys help pinpoint \nthe type and severity of sexual dysfunction. \nTo plan treatment, your provider will identify \nthe causes of sexual dysfunction. Be ready \nto give an update on your health history and \nmedications. You will likely get blood tests of \ntestosterone if your testes were affected by \ncancer treatment.\nBased on an assessment, you may be referred \nto other providers. \n \u0086Sexual health specialists are experts \nin sexual function. They may have a \nbackground in primary care, gynecology, \nurology, oncology, psychology, or \nrehabilitation medicine.\n \u0086Mental health professionals can provide \nsex and couples therapy. They also treat \nissues related to sexual function, such as \ndepression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. \u0086Gynecologists are doctors who are \nexperts in the female reproductive system. \nUrologists are doctors who are experts in \nthe urinary tract and the male reproductive \nsystem.\n \u0086Fertility specialists help people have \nbabies. Your cancer doctor will refer you to \na fertility specialist if you want to have kids \nafter treatment. \nAnxiety? You are not alone, \nespecially for the newly diagnosed.  \nIt will get better!

It is a common effect of \nchemotherapy, radiation therapy, blood stem \n(hematopoietic) cell transplant, and biological \ntherapy. It sometimes occurs after surgery. \nCancer survivors may have mild to moderate \nfatigue for months or years after diagnosis.Screening and assessment\nYour health care provider may screen for \nfatigue on a regular basis. Fatigue screening \ntools consist of a brief scale or survey. There \nis no exam or lab test for fatigue. Fatigue \nscreening helps identify people with fatigue and \nassess treatment results.\nFatigue ranges from mild to severe levels. Your \nprovider will perform an in-depth assessment \nif you have moderate or severe fatigue months \nafter initial treatment. An assessment is also \nneeded if fatigue starts or worsens after \ntreatment ends. \nYour provider will ask you questions. Be ready \nto describe when the fatigue started and \nwhether it\u2019s changed over time. Your provider \nwill also assess for causes of fatigue that can \nbe treated. Some health conditions that cause \nfatigue are listed in Guide 13 .\nYour provider will order blood tests if needed. \nA complete blood count (CBC) with differential \nmeasures parts of the blood, such as red blood \ncells. A comprehensive metabolic panel can \nshow if you have liver or kidney problems. \nLevels of hormones can be checked using a \nblood sample.\nSome people may need further testing. Your \nprovider may order imaging if you have \nconcerning symptoms. Imaging makes pictures \nof the insides of your body.

Assessment and referral\nIf you are at risk for lymphedema, your cancer \ndoctor will ask about symptoms at health \nvisits. Lymphedema can occur any time after \ncancer treatment but most often occurs within \n18 months. If symptoms are present, your \ndoctor will ask questions about:\n \u0086How often and severe is the swelling\n \u0086Pain or discomfort\n \u0086Loss of strength, range of motion, or \nmobility\n \u0086Ability to do things you usually do\nTo confirm that you have lymphedema, tests \nare needed to rule out a return or worsening of \ncancer. You then may be referred to a certified \nlymphedema therapist. This therapist may be a \nphysician, an occupational therapist, or physical \ntherapist.\nThe therapist may measure your limb. If not \nmeasured before treatment, the swollen limb \ncan be compared to the normal limb. You may \nneed to do stretches to check your range of \nmotion.\nLymphedema may cause or worsen distress, \ndepression, or anxiety. Tell your provider if you \nfeel distressed. There is help.

In addition, a pilot study asses sed the use of electronic \nhealth records (EHRs) to reduce the time and effort involved with creating \ncare plans.165 Although many plan elements required manual entry by the \noncologist, the median time to complete the plans was only 3 minutes \n(range 2 \u201312 minutes ). Another group reported on a similar initiative to \nfacilitate genera tion of care plans using EHRs.166 Care plan creation took a \nmean 12 minutes (range 10 \u201315 minutes). However, a study in which EHR -\nbased treatment summaries were abstracted and cross -checked revealed \nthat 30% contained \u22651 omissions , and 10% contained \u22651 errors, indicating \nthat autopopulatio n systems will require manual double -checking to \nensure accuracy.167 Thus, providing a survivorship care plan is time -\nconsuming and resource -intensive and could have unforeseen \nharms.154,168 \nBecause definitive evidence that survivorship care plans improve \noutcomes is lacking, the NCCN Survivo rship Panel currently recommends \nplanning for ongoing survivorship care, but does not mandate the use of \nsurvivorship care  plans . The plan ning should include:  \n\u2022 Information on treatment received including all surgeries, radiation \ntherapy, and systemic therap ies \n\u2022 Information regarding follow -up care , surveillance, and screening \nrecommendations  \u2022 Information on post -treatment needs, including information \nregarding acute, late and long -term treatment -related effects , and \nhealth risks when possible (See NCCN Guidelines  for Treatment of \nCancer by Site ) \n\u2022 Delineation regarding roles of oncologists, PCP s, and subspecialty \ncare physicians in long-term care and timing of transfer of care if \nappropriate  \n\u2022 Healthy behavior recommendations  \n\u2022 Periodic  assessment of ongoing needs and identification of \nappropriate resources  \nData from o ngoing trials will help inform future recommendations . \nSurveillance fo r Cancer Recurrence  \nScreening for cancer recurrence is an important aspect of survivorship \ncare. In general, this surveillance is performed by the oncology team. \nWhen surveillance is overseen by the primary care team, the oncologist \nshould provide evidence -based recommendations based on currently \navailable guidelines. Specific recommendations for surveillance testing \nvary between cancer site and stage and individualized patient risk and are \nnot addressed in these guidelines. Please see individual NCCN Guide lines \nfor Treatment of Cancer by Site (available online at www.NCCN.org ) for \ndisease -specific surveillance recommendations. Additional lab work, \nimaging studies, or other studies to eval uate for recurrence should be \nbased on clinical presentation and judgment. The use of radiologic \nimaging studies (ie, CT) should be based on evidence that early detection \nof recurrence will improve cancer -related outcomes, because evidence \nsuggests that ex cess radiation exposure associated with CT imaging may \nbe associated with an increased risk of developing a radiation -associated \ncancer.169,170", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75e570ba-a5a8-4d1d-b180-42de04336938": {"__data__": {"id_": "75e570ba-a5a8-4d1d-b180-42de04336938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f75f927c-75b2-49bd-925f-0c289210971d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "3f1d9303590e6fa4dcb3582fd0f44e1a52270ef49b88c90511bd36bb9015c279"}}, "hash": "3f1d9303590e6fa4dcb3582fd0f44e1a52270ef49b88c90511bd36bb9015c279", "text": "Hormonal symptoms \ncan have a profound impact on quality  of life.783,793  \nPremenopausal cancer survivors who have received chemotherapy may \nexperience transient or permanent menopause , dependent on the age of \nthe patient and the type of chemotherapy.794-796 If appropriate and desired, \nreferral for fertility preservation should be considered before \nchemotherapy, because s tudies report that 33% to 73% of premenopausal \npatients  treated for breast cancer become peri - or postmenopausal after \ntreatment.783 Younger survivors with irregular menses may have primary", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0916c33-bde3-4182-a839-bcf21809db8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0916c33-bde3-4182-a839-bcf21809db8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "23fc58cd-9eda-40a3-b35e-909c115f5728", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "6f9895751512f0a3b15cd90706d6c17ef95d3bda5d9f249115fe66f79cc0f83d"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ebb27c6-2905-4bbc-952e-f5754e98cb37", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "bd61a1b81703da4db405e8df54f4a42b5f52c01b6a7d77818686f230abb438a2"}}, "hash": "d0f358fb899950e541225bb123066bd71955fd125067d7a629b608953d3c4051", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-31 optimal timing of troponin assessment in relation to completion of \nchemotherapy is currently unclear, the cut -off point for a positive test  is \nundefined , and the optimal assay platform remains to be determined.

Injury or stress on the myocardium (such as during and after \ntreatment with anthracyclines) can lead to activation of endogenous \nneurohormonal systems, which play a critical role i n cardiac remodeling \nand therefore progre ssion to Stage B heart failure.  \nThe panel recommends that heart failure risk factors, including \nhypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome , and diabetes , be addressed in \nall survivors  who have completed anthracycline  therapy . In addition, \nsurvivors with a history of anthracycline therapy should be advised to  \nengage in regular physical activity, eat a healthy diet, and avoid behaviors \nthat may increase the risk of heart failure or CVD  (eg, cigarette/ tobacco or \nillicit drug use). Physical activity has been shown to improve control of \nhypertension and to slow cardiac remodeling in breast cancer survivors \nwith heart failure.507 Involvement of the survivor\u2019s primary care provider in \nmanaging risk factors is encouraged.  \nThe panel recommends that a low threshold be established for referral to a \ncardio -oncologist or cardiologist for all patients previously treated with an \nanthracycline. Additional recommendations for each sta ge of heart failure \nare discussed below.  Treatment of Stage A Heart Failure  \nStage A heart failure recognizes several well -established risk factors , each \nof which contribute to early stage s of heart failure. These include \nhypertension, CAD , diabetes mellitus, a family history of heart failure , or a \nhistory of cardiotoxins such as anthracyclines. Therefore, all survivors  with \nexposure to anthracyclines have, by definition, at least one risk factor that \npredisposes them to cardiac disease  and s hould be treated  as \nappropriate. Other anti -cancer systemic therapies are potentially \ncardiotoxic and may increase the risk of cardiac disease.439 Involvement of \nthe survivor\u2019s PCP in the management of survivors with cardiac risk \nfactors is encouraged. Management can include addressing under lying \nrisk factors, recommending physical activity and healthy dietary habits, \nand referral to a cardiologist.  \nTreatment of Stages B, C, and D Heart Failure  \nThe panel recommends referral to a cardiologist for all survivors with \nStages B, C, or D heart fail ure.

Common barriers include not having enough time \nto exercise, not hav ing access to an acceptable exercise environment, \nuncertainty about safety of exercise post -treatment, lack of knowledge \nregarding appropriate activities, and physical limitations.250 Alleviation of \npain, fatigue, distress, or nutritional deficits can facilitate the initiation of an \nexercise program.  \nRisk Assessment for Exercise -Induced Adverse Events  \nExercise is considered safe for most survivors .214,215,251 However, a \nsignificant portion of survivors may have comorbid conditions or risk \nfactors that make them unable to safely exercise without trained \nsupervision.252 Therefore, a risk assessment is required for all survivors \nbefore prescribing a specific exercise program.214,253 The type of cancer, \ntreatment modalities received, and the number and severity of \ncomorbidities determine risk levels.251 Thus, disease and treatment \nhistory, late and long -term effects, and comorbidities should be assessed. \nA standardized pre-participa tion screening questionnaire, such as the \nPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone  (PAR-Q+),254 can \nalso be considered to identify patients for whom unsupervised physical \nactivity is likely safe versus those for whom it may pose undue risk.  \nSurvivors with peripheral neuropathy, poor bone health, a rthritis , or \nmusculoskeletal issues  are considered to be at moderate risk for exercise -\ninduced adverse events. Stability , balance,  and gait should be assessed in \nsurvivors with peripheral neuropathy and possibly in survivors with poor \nbone health before they engage  in exercise , and exercise choice should \nbe made based on the results (ie, stationary bike or water aerobics for \nsurvivors with poor balance).  In addition, balance training can be \nrecommended for patients at risk for  falls. Moderate -risk survivors can \noften follow the general recommendations for physical activity; however, medical clearance and/or referrals to trained personnel such as a physical \nor occupational therapist, certified exercise professional , or rehabilit ation \nspecialist can also be considered.  Specialized training in working with \nsurvivors is available for both physical therapists and exercise \nprofessionals through the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM; \nhttp://www.acsm.org/get -certified ) and the American Physical Therapy \nAssociation (APTA) Oncology section ( http://oncologypt.org/ ). Survivors \nshould be encouraged to use an ACSM - or APTA -certified trainer when \navailable.  \nLymphedema is not a contraindication for physical activity, and no special \nprecautions are required for cardiovascular/aerobic exercise or strength \ntraining of unaffec ted limbs  (see Survivor Lymphedema Education, \nbelow ).255-260 Progressive resistance training under supervision is \nrecommended as part of treatment for survivors with lymphedema (see \nTreatment  of Lymphedema, above).  \nSurvivors at high risk for exercise -assoc iated adverse events include \nthose with a history of lung surgery or major abdominal surgery, an \nostomy, cardiopulmonary comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease [COPD], congestive heart failure [ CHF], coronary artery disease \n[CAD ], cardiom yopathy), ataxia, s evere nutritional deficiencies , severe \nfatigue, or worsening/changing physical condition (eg, lymphedema \nexacerbation).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4e178fb-b81d-46bc-8d79-4f34c2c0fe60": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4e178fb-b81d-46bc-8d79-4f34c2c0fe60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94280831-7e76-496a-a2d4-908e1967ab83", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "b9609bbdc0906f48a705c0728b086cf69faa68dd7f5f48226f56881cc62ea3f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "d65683c5-dee2-4512-8eb3-1584fad6d694", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "c3a134ea393878f626dcb4bca900eb2f6c7a234e70c84a0bbc2fc3a16612224d"}}, "hash": "4c2d818b1a6958d1975b46316265d0e4aaa61b7015d3c90fa3e9a32e5b7c9ae0", "text": "These survivors should receive medical evaluation and \nclearance prior to initiation of an exercise program and referr al to trained \npersonnel for a supervised exercise program.251 In general, exercise \nshould be individualized to the participant based on current exercise level \nand medical factors and should be increased in terms of intensity, \nduration, and frequency as t olerated.  \nPhysical Activity Recommendations for Survivors  \nBoth the ACS and the ACSM have made physical activity \nrecommendations for cancer survivors.212,261 In addition, the panel also", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c858aebd-1d48-4c6a-a747-784c34ec0303": {"__data__": {"id_": "c858aebd-1d48-4c6a-a747-784c34ec0303", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "23acc890-8422-4c16-8613-3a25356ad04f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "a46cb4132c8ffe8e26583429f628181074ebd35d73c0e57c1c877b504980cf4c"}}, "hash": "a46cb4132c8ffe8e26583429f628181074ebd35d73c0e57c1c877b504980cf4c", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-25 Tools exist to help quantify atherosclerotic CVD risk (eg, ASCVD risk \nscore451), but the se tools do not take into account cancer treatment history \n(eg, anthracycline or tyrosine kinase inhibitor [ TKI] exposure) and thus \nmay not accurately capture true CVD risk in a given survivor.   \nThe panel recommend s that physicians provide CVD risk assessm ent and \ncounseling on CVD risk factor management to all cancer survivors \nthroughout the survivorship continuum.

In fact, antibody titers to vaccine -preventable diseases \ndecrease after anti -cancer treatment.399,400 In addition, survivors are at \nincreased risk of complications from vaccine -preventable diseases, such \nas those caused by HPV and influenza viruses.400,401  \nMany infections in survivors can be prevented by the use of vaccines. \nHowever, data from the BRFSS found that 42% of survivors did not \nreceive an influenza vaccinati on in 2009, and 52% reported never \nreceiving a pneumococcal vaccination.183 Analysis of the SEER -Medicare \ndatabase showed that survivors  of breast cancer, aged  \u226565 years, were \nless likely to receive an influenza vaccination than matched non -cancer \ncontrols.141 A separate analysis of the SEER -Medicare database by \nanother group found similar results.402 \nVaccines represent a unique challenge in cancer and transplant survivors, \nbecause they may or may not trigger the desired protective immune \nresponses due to possible residual immune deficits.403-405 In addition, certain vaccines, such as those that are live attenuated (eg, zoster [ZVL, \nMMRV, or VAR]; MMR), are contraindicated in active ly \nimmunosuppressed survivors because of an increased risk of developing \nthe disease and/or prolonged shedding of the live organism given in the \nvaccine.  \nRisk Assessment and Screening for Immunizations and Prevention of \nInfections  \nSurvivors are at elevated risk for infections if their cancer treatment \nincluded chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab, \nalemtuzumab), radiation, corticosteroids, splenectomy,  CAR T -cell \ntherapy , and/or HCT (which includes peripheral blood stem cell \ntransplanta tion, bone marrow transplantation, and cord blood \ntransplantation). Risk is also elevated if the survivor has prior or current \nexposure to endemic infections or epidemics, or has a history of blood \ntransfusion.  \nInterventions for Prevention of Infections  \nInfection in survivors can be prevented by education, antimicrobial \nprophylaxis, and the judicious use of vaccines. For information regarding \nantimicrobial prophylaxis, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Prevention \nand Treatment of Cancer -Related Infections (available online at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nEducation  \nSurvivors should be educated about safe pet care, the avoidance of \nzoonosis, travel precautions, gardening precautions , proper hand hygiene , \nand avoidance of respiratory droplets  during a respiratory virus \npandemic .406-413 Contact with pets did not increase the risk of fever, \nbacteremia, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis in children with acute myeloid \nleukemia  (AML) ,414 and the panel believes that contact with pets is \ngenerally safe for most survivors.

The report also \nacknowledged the limited data available  to inform their recommendations.  \nIn 2017, ASCO released a c linical practice guideline  for the prevention and \nmonitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult cancers.493 The \nASCO panel gave a moderate -strength recommendation (as based on evidence and the balance between harms and benefits) that \nechocardiogram can be performed for asymptomatic survivors deemed to \nbe at increased risk for  cardiac dysfunction at 6 to 12 months after \ntreatment, including survivors with a history of anthracycline therapy. \nInsufficient evidence prevented the ASCO panel from making a \nrecommendation regarding the frequency and duration of additional \nsurveillance  of survivors who are asymptomatic and who showed no signs \nof cardiac dysfunction on initial assessment.  \nThe NCCN Survivorship Panel defined its screening recommendations \nbased largely on consensus and on the idea that early recognition and \ntreatment of ca rdiotoxicity can allow for earlier interventions that may \nimprove prognosis (discussed below).  \nAssessment for Symptoms of Heart Failure  \nAccording to the 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines, the cardinal manifestations of \nclinical heart failure (Stage C) include dyspne a and fatigue (which may \nlead to limited exercise tolerance) or fluid retention (which may lead to \npulmonary and peripheral edema).494 These symptoms  can lead to \ndecreased functional capacity and affect quality of life. Heart failure \nsymptoms associated with fluid retention may also include orthopnea or \nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Therefore, the panel recommends a \nhistory and physical to look for these symptoms to help identify survivors \nwho might already be symptomatic. These survivors should  undergo \nevaluation with  an echocardiogram . If no evidence of structural heart \ndisease is seen, then a workup for other causes of the  symptoms is \nwarranted with referral to other specialties (eg, pulmonology or cardiology) \nas needed.

The panel recognizes that not all individuals with a history of cancer identify with the term \"survivor.\" These guidelines \nare meant to be inclusive and use the term \"survivor\" to describe anyone with a history of cancer.\n\u2022 These guidelines focus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer have on the adult survivor. This \nincludes the potential impact on physical and mental states, health behaviors, professional and personal identity , sexuality, and financial \nstanding. It is appropriate to counsel on these impacts early in the treatment trajectory and at regular intervals thereafter.\n\u2022 These guidelines are applicable to survivors across the continuum of care, including those on prolonged therapy, those with chronic \ncancers (eg, metastatic disease), and long-term survivors.\n\u2022 The panel recognizes the growing population of individuals who are living with metastatic disease and that many aspects of these guidelines \npertain to this population of survivors. This group is included in the definition of survivorship, and these guidelines are meant to be applied \nwhen helpful to meet the individuals' needs. \n\u2022 The panel recommends reviewing the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship in conjunction with the cancer-specific guidelines for individuals \nwith metastatic disease. As more evidence is established for this population, more specific survivorship guidelines for individuals living with \nmetastatic cancers may be developed..\n\n\n\n\nSURV-1", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a8f7604-5bbe-4cae-b196-f3346723e8d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a8f7604-5bbe-4cae-b196-f3346723e8d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5075bcfa-c8ee-488c-bf9f-95e6d1e9fe3e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "c8f403d0179d21f20754b952b5cc7f0e427b7c3c90863d0aceceb6745a347c67"}}, "hash": "c8f403d0179d21f20754b952b5cc7f0e427b7c3c90863d0aceceb6745a347c67", "text": "Survivorship  Review\nReview\n \u0086A person with cancer is a survivor starting \nat diagnosis and through the balance of \ntheir life.\n \u0086Survivorship care is needed for the large \nand rising number of survivors.

Additional recommendations for cognitive dysfunction in older \nadults can be found in the cognitive function section of the NCCN \nGuidelines for Older Adult Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org ).  \nNonpharmacologic Interventions for Cognitive Dysfunction  \nProspective data to inform the use or potential benefits of non -\npharmacologic interventions for cancer survivors who complain of \ncognitive dysfunction  are limited. Practical suggestions include instruction \nin self -management and coping strategies (eg, using planners, reminder \nnotes, and/or smart phone technology; keeping items in the same place), \nwhich the panel believes can be very helpful to patients. Discontinuation or \nlimitation of use of medications known to cause or contribute to cognitive \nimpairment should be attempted. Management of depression/emotional \ndistress, pain, sleep disturbances, and fatigue should be provided. In fact, \na study showed that CBT for fatigue was e ffective at reducing self -\nreported cognitive disability and concentration problems in 98 severely \nfatigued cancer survivors  randomized to CBT compared with those \nrandomized to a wait list.635 However, no difference in neuropsychological \ntest performance  was observed.  \nCBT for cognitive dysfunction may also help some survivors. In one small \nstudy, CBT was evaluated in 40 breast cancer survivors using a waitlist \ncontrol trial design.636 Although overall quality of life improved with the \nintervention, statistically significant improvement was noted only with \nverbal memory, not with self -reports of daily cognitive complaints. Ano ther \nstudy of CBT delivered by video conference in 47 survivors of breast \ncancer found that CBT led to improvements in self-reported  cognitive \nimpairment  and in neuropsychological processing speed  compared with \nsupportive therapy.637 \nRoutine physical activity should be encouraged. Substantial evidence \nshows that physical activity enhances cognitive function in elderly people \nin general, although only few studies specific to cancer survivors have been repor ted.638-642 A small randomized controlled trial  of an exercise \nintervention versus control in breast cancer survivors evaluated objective \nand self -reported cognition.642 The exercise intervention significantly \nimproved processing speed among those who had been diagnosed within \nthe past 2 years , but no other significant differences were observed . \nCognitive training (ie, brain games)  can also be considered. Cognitive \ntraining has demonstrated benefits in self -reported and objectively \nassessed cognitive function, including memory, executive function, and \nverbal function .639,643 One study randomized 157 breast cancer survivors \nto web-based cognitive training with telephone support or to wait-list \ncontrol .644 Verbal learning and results on a working memory test showed \nstatistically significant improvement in the cognitive training group, but no \nimprovements were seen for an objective measure of working memory \nand a measure of perceived cognitive functioning . Another study used a 5 -\nsession, small -group intervention of psychoeducation and cognitive \nexercises  in 48 breast cancer survivors.645 Compared to survivors \nrandomized to a wait -list control group, survivors in the intervention arm \nexperienced i mprovements in self -reported cognit ive complaints and \nmemory functioning on neurocognitive testing . A larger study of 242 \nsurvivors with self -reported , persistent cognitive symptoms  after \nchemotherapy for non -CNS cancers found that survivors randomized to a \nweb-based cognitive training prog ram had statistically significant \nimprovements in perceived cognitive impairment  immediately and 6 \nmonths after the intervention.646 Improvements in anxiety, depression, \nfatigue, and stress were also seen after the intervention, which used \nadaptive exercises that targeted cognitive domains, such as visual \nprecision, working memory, and visual processing speed.  \nRelaxation, stress manage ment,  meditation, and yoga can also be \nconsidered.

Occupational \ntherapy strategies focus on improvement of cognitive fu nctioning and may \nbe most effective for individuals who note the impact of specific functional \nlimitations, such as word finding, comprehension, and task completion, on \nwork performance, quality of life, or role expectations.650 Psychotherapy is \nanother option.  \nPharmacologic Interventions for Cognitive Dysfunctio n \nIf nonpharmacologic interventions have been insufficient, consideration of \na trial of medications such as methylphenidate, modafinil, or donepezil is \nreasonable in select survivors or certain clinical scenarios , although data \ninforming the efficacy of th ese agents are lacking. Trials assessing the \neffects of the psychostimulant methylphenidate have reported mixed \nresults.651 For example, a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind \ntrial found that d -methylphenidate had no effect on neuropsychological test \nscores.652 In contrast, a randomized, double -blind, crossover trial of child \nsurvivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or brain tumors showed \nthat methylphenidate was more effective than placebo at improving \nattention, cognitive flexibi lity, and processing speed.653 \nResults of studies on modafinil, another psychostimulant, are more \nconsistent. A randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of \nmodafinil for fatigue and c ognitive function in breast cancer survivors \nfound significantly greater improvement in memory and attention among patients receiving modafinil than in the placebo group.654 Similarly, a \ndouble -blind, randomized, crossover trial also in breast cancer survivors \nfound that participants rec eiving modafinil performed significantly better on \ncognitive tests of attention and psychomotor speed.655 Benefits with \ntreatment were also noted among patients with primary brain tumors.656 \nDonepezil  is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat patients with \nAlzheimer\u2019s  disease. It has been studied for its effects on cognitive \nimpairments after the treatment of brain tumors, with modest \nimprovements seen in attention/concentration , memory, and motor speed \nand dexterity .657,658 Donepezil was also studied in a randomized trial of 62 \nbreas t cancer survivors who had received adjuvant chemotherapy .659 \nAlthough there were no differences in subjective cognitive function, the \ndonepezil group showed improved memory on objective tests.  Further \nwork is needed before concrete recommendations for pharmacologic \ntherapy in survivor populations can be made.  \nFatigue  \nNote: The  text regarding fatigue in survivors has been a dapted \nfrom the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer -Related Fatigue (available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nNCCN defines cancer -related fatigue as \u201ca distressing, persistent, \nsubjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or \nexhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to \nrecent activity and interferes with usual functioning.\u201d660 Fatigue is a \ncommon symptom in patients with cancer and is nearly universal in those \nreceiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow \ntransplantation, or treatmen t with biological response modifiers.661-663 \nAccording to a survey of 1569 patients with cancer, the symptom is \nexperienced by 80% of individuals who receive chemotherapy and/or \nradiotherapy.664,665 Cancer survivors report that fatigue continues to be a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bbee8f1-9557-444c-8f18-fac2ca1536d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bbee8f1-9557-444c-8f18-fac2ca1536d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "184", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a605542f-baf0-4bfd-9013-6eabcb35ed3e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "184", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "ff80d43816502329cf3241aa57d7bcc68171e25252d6b6379de62b71c6719038"}, "3": {"node_id": "781c6abf-3e1c-464c-9f7b-d4bb2a5cc54d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "184", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "157b6a0bfa3ab0ffb20b9e5090afdd568d8e44cf0dffcf2f6021efb917c2a2b5"}}, "hash": "f376ff4ecaec87fd8345da0b3cdce9d5860f38ce52b3732500abe27cdd64cac1", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-44 symptoms  may include pain or discomfort and/or sensations of heaviness, \nfatigue, fullness, and/or tightness in the skin. Symptoms including \ndecreased  range of motion or strength and thickening of the skin may \noccur in later stages. If symptoms are present, survivors should be asked \nabout the frequency and severity of swelling, pain and/or discomfort, any \nissues with strength or range of motion and mobi lity (ie, bending, \nstretching, flexibility), and whether symptoms interfere with daily activities.  \nIf lymphedema symptoms are present, a recurrence of cancer should be \nruled out. The survivor should then be referred to a certified lymphedema \ntherapist, if available, for additional assessments. These assessments can \ninclude subjective signs and symptoms of lymphedema and limb volume \nmeasurements. Ideally, pretreatment limb measurement of both sides \nshould be performed as a baseline prior to ini tiation of any therapy for \nthose with treatment -related or individual risk factors. If not, the \ncontralateral limb can be used for comparison in the post -treatment \nsetting. Clinical examination by a lymphedema therapist may include \nrange of motion, muscle performance, circulation, sensation, \nhemodynamic monitoring, and functional mobility.   \nSurvivors with lymphedema should also be assessed for distress (see \nAnxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Distress , above).  \nTreatment of Lymphedema  \nHigh-level evidence suppo rting treatments for lymphedema are lacking, \nand most studies have been performed in breast cancer survivors.31,760 -762 \nMost of the recommendations  made by the panel are thus based on lower -\nlevel evidence, clinical experience, and expert consensus.  \nThe oncology team should provide education regarding self -care \nmanagement, including i nfection prevention measures, risk -reduction \nstrategies, and mainten ance of skin integrity on the affected side  (see \nSurvivor Lymphedema Education , below).  Distress should be treated if present (see Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Distress , above). Referral \nshould be made to a certified lymphedema therapist, if available,  for \nprescription and fitting of c ompression garments , performance of manual \nlymphatic drainage, and direction of supervised progressive strength \ntraining . If a certified lymphedema therapist is not available, referral to an \nappropriate alternative provide r for treatment  should be consider ed. \nCompression garments have been shown to reduce limb volume, and are \noften used with other modalities such as manual lymphatic drainage.762-764 \nManual lymphatic drainage is performed by a specific massage technique \ndesigned to encourage lymph fluid  to drain from the affected area. \nSystematic reviews and meta -analyses hav e assessed the efficacy of \nmanual lymphatic drainage in breast cancer survivors with lymphedema \nand found that it can provide additional benefit when added to standard \ntherapy.765,766 In particular, compression bandaging al one leads to  limb \nvolume reductions of 30% to 3 9%, and manual lymphatic drainage \nappears to increase that reduction by  an additional 7%.  \nProgressive strength training and physical activity are not associated with \nexacerbation or development of lymphedema , and may improve \nlymphedema symptoms .214,255 -259,767 -770 The WISER Survivor trial \nrandomized 351 overweight breast cancer survivors with  lymphedema to a \ncontrol group that received hospital -based care, a

\nactivity challenging. Don\u2019t get discouraged. Talk \nto your care provider about ways to be active. \nLymphedema\nLymphedema is a buildup of bodily fluid called \nlymph. It should not stop you from being \nphysically active. Higher-intensity activity is \nsafe. Full use of your limbs can be maintained \nwith resistance training and range-of-motion \nexercises.\n \u0086Work with a trained provider if possible.\n \u0086Get checked on a regular basis for the \nstart or worsening of lymphedema.\n \u0086Exercise limbs with lymphedema only if \nthe lymphedema is stable. \n \u0086Stop exercising and see a lymphedema \nspecialist if lymphedema worsens.\n \u0086Increase your strength with resistance \ntraining in small steps. \n \u0086Compression garments may be needed \nduring resistance training.\nOstomy\nAn ostomy is a surgically created change in the \nway stool or urine leaves the body. A stoma is a \nhole created in the wall of the abdomen through \nwhich stool or urine passes out. You can be \nactive while having a stoma. \n \u0086Empty the ostomy bag before exercising.\n \u0086Slowly increase strength with resistance \ntraining that is overseen by a trained \nprovider. \u0086Perform core exercises that have been \nrevised to reduce pressure on the \nabdomen.\n \u0086Don\u2019t do Valsalva maneuvers since you \nare at risk for hernias.\n \u0086Use an ostomy protector during contact \nsports or when there\u2019s risk for injury to the \nostomy.\n \u0086Stay hydrated during physical activity, \nespecially if you have an ileostomy.\nPeripheral neuropathy\nPeripheral neuropathy is a type of nerve \ndamage.

Your \ncancer and primary care providers will manage \nrisk factors. An expert in heart disease, called \na cardiologist, treats stage B, C, and D heart \nfailure. This doctor may prescribe medication \nand other treatment to keep your heart as \nhealthy as possible.\nReview\n \u0086Cardiovascular disease is a group of \ndisorders of the heart and blood vessels. \n \u0086Cancer survivors are more likely to \ndevelop cardiovascular disease than \npeople who never have had cancer.\n \u0086A risk factor is anything that increases \nyour chance for cardiovascular disease. \nReducing risk factors can help prevent \ncardiovascular disease and events. Risk \nfactors that can be managed include high \nblood pressure, high cholesterol, and \nobesity.\n \u0086To reduce your risk, follow the ABCDEs \nof cardiovascular wellness. To start, learn about your risk factors of cardiovascular \ndisease. Your care providers will monitor \nand help manage risk factors that can be \nchanged.\n \u0086Anthracyclines are a type of \nchemotherapy. They increase the risk of \nheart failure. \n \u0086Screening for heart failure within 1 year \nafter anthracycline treatment is needed. \nYou may get an echocardiogram. An \nechocardiogram detects structural \nchanges in the heart.\n \u0086After anthracycline treatment, it \nis important to lower your risk of \ncardiovascular disease including heart \nfailure.

conjunction with primary care, survivors should be assessed for metabolic health and body composition independently of BMI.\n\u2022 Weight management includes a three-pronged approach: caloric management, physical activity, and behavior modification.\n\u2022 Providers should discuss strategies for weight management and optimal metabolic health, including how to achieve low overall body fat and \nhigher amounts of muscle mass. \n \u25caPractice portion control.\n \u25caMake informed food choices through routine evaluation of food labels.\n \u25caIncorporate physical activity,
