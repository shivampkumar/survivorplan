There are several models of care that \nframe the implementation of survivorship care according to provider \ntype(s), clinic type(s), patient risk, and other factors.

The panel recognizes that not all individuals with a history of cancer identify with the term \"survivor.\" These guidelines \nare meant to be inclusive and use the term \"survivor\" to describe anyone with a history of cancer.\n\u2022 These guidelines focus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer have on the adult survivor. This \nincludes the potential impact on physical and mental states, health behaviors, professional and personal identity , sexuality, and financial \nstanding. It is appropriate to counsel on these impacts early in the treatment trajectory and at regular intervals thereafter.\n\u2022 These guidelines are applicable to survivors across the continuum of care, including those on prolonged therapy, those with chronic \ncancers (eg, metastatic disease), and long-term survivors.\n\u2022 The panel recognizes the growing population of individuals who are living with metastatic disease and that many aspects of these guidelines \npertain to this population of survivors. This group is included in the definition of survivorship, and these guidelines are meant to be applied \nwhen helpful to meet the individuals' needs. \n\u2022 The panel recommends reviewing the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship in conjunction with the cancer-specific guidelines for individuals \nwith metastatic disease. As more evidence is established for this population, more specific survivorship guidelines for individuals living with \nmetastatic cancers may be developed..\n\n\n\n\nSURV-1", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be01e8a4-224d-431e-bda9-a315851a2ff7": {"__data__": {"id_": "be01e8a4-224d-431e-bda9-a315851a2ff7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e6877d8c-828c-481f-bc92-466c235e1062", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "82696164c74a4394161bbc03efc5ba71a20677143c6e7d6c2ddd829d8ef07321"}}, "hash": "82696164c74a4394161bbc03efc5ba71a20677143c6e7d6c2ddd829d8ef07321", "text": "STANDARDS FOR SURVIVORSHIP CAREb\nCare of the cancer survivor should include:\n1.

They \ncan be used to optimize health and wellness for all survivors; however, they were created to assist health care professionals who work with survivors \nof adult-onset cancer in the post-treatment period, including those in both the oncology and primary care practices. \n\u2022 The panel recognizes that many of the post-treatment issues covered in these Guidelines are best addressed before cancer treatment begins so that \nmany problems can be prevented or minimized.\n\u2022 These guidelines are designed to provide a framework for the general survivorship care and management of potential long-term and/or late effects of \ncancer and its treatment that survivors may experience.\n\u2022 The NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship should be used as a supplement to the follow-up recommendations within the disease-specific guidelines. See \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site and NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care for recommendations regarding metastatic disease. \n\u2022 These guidelines, with the appropriate disease-specific guideline, provide a framework for the coordination of care between the survivor's health care \nproviders to ensure that needs are appropriately addressed.\n\u2022 The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be addressed at every visit. The panel recommends periodic screening assessments and \nappropriate follow-up care as clinically indicated. \n\u2022 Referral to other health care disciplines/providers or community resources may be used to address several indications or identified issues with one \nintervention (eg, rehabilitation for fatigue, depression, and pain).\n\u2022 The panel recommends stakeholders ensure the implementation of guideline-concordant survivorship care within their unique health \nsystems.1  Specifically, institutions are encouraged to determine how to systematically deliver the six key components of survivorship care \n(SURV-1).1-3 There are several models of care that frame the implementation of survivorship care according to provider type(s), clinic type(s), \npatient risk, and other factors.4-7 Engaging these models of care will facilitate implementation planning.7 Panel members recommend \ninstitutions provide the resources necessary to plan, deliver, and evaluate their survivorship care program(s).1-2\n\u2022 For survivorship issues related to younger populations, also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and the \nChildren's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers  \n(www.survivorshipguidelines.org).\n\u2022 For survivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune-mediated toxicities is warranted.

This increased risk is due to genetic susceptibilities (eg, \nhereditary cancer syndromes) and/or family history, shared etiologic exposures (eg, smoking, environmental exposures, health behaviors, \nhuman papillomavirus [HPV]), and mutagenic effects of cancer treatment. Health behaviors should be modified as possible (eg, smoking \ncessation, weight management) to decrease the risk of subsequent malignancies.\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyle and behavioral counseling are important to reduce risk factors that may contribute to subsequent cancers (HL-1).\n\u2022 Treatment-related subsequent primary cancers vary with the type and intensity of anticancer treatment and are associated in particular with \nRT and specific chemotherapeutic agents. For recommendations for screening considerations, s ee Principles of Screening for Treatment-\nRelated Subsequent Primary Cancers (SURV-C).\n\u2022 Screening for subsequent primary cancers should be a shared responsibility between primary and oncology care physicians. For survivors \nliving with metastatic disease, recommendations for screening should be tailored to the survivor's individualized risk and disease status.  \n(See the NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, and Risk Reduction  ). \n\u2022 Evidence suggests that excess lifetime radiation exposure from CT imaging may be associated with a mildly increased risk of developing a \nradiation-associated cancer. Use of radiologic studies to screen for recurrent cancer should be based on diagnosis and evidence that early \ndetection of recurrence will improve cancer-related outcomes. Recommendations for surveillance imaging modality and frequency can be \nfound in the NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site.\n\u2022 For familial assessment considerations that impact screening, see SURV-5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b13a89d9-66f6-4c36-a375-69dc6928aa00": {"__data__": {"id_": "b13a89d9-66f6-4c36-a375-69dc6928aa00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf0a9251-ad07-4e32-95db-b0efed785f82", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "7b0d99bfe746bb15cbe36a2456dc2c79ea283d5c806c567bcc6f2f6208018075"}}, "hash": "74ef915c073cd1e815a440bbdb2c5ee442dd463fe013d0e7ff21c576cdc790d5", "text": ".\n\n\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT AND COUNSELING\nSURV-5\u2022 Periodic updating of family cancer history (when known) is recommended to reassess hereditary risk. Genetic testing guidelines and \nknowledge about hereditary cancer risk evolve over time and new family diagnoses may occur making periodic assessment important. \n\u2022 Comprehensive family history including any prior genetic testing is the first step in genetic risk assessment.\n\u2022 Many cancer survivors, particularly those diagnosed at younger ages, as well as those diagnosed with rare cancers, multiple primary \ncancers, or cancers associated with high-risk cancer syndromes, and those with one or more relatives with the same or related cancers \nare candidates for risk assessment per guidelines from NCCN and other expert groups. Genetic testing is recommended for appropriate \nsurvivors based on results of the risk assessment. (See General Testing Criteria [CRIT-1] from the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial \nHigh-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic)\n\u0017Criteria for formal genetic risk assessment and/or testing, and for care of patients with known germline mutations linked to an increased \nrisk for cancer can be found in the following NCCN Guidelines:\n \u25caNCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic\n \u2013Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling (EVAL-A)\n \u2013Pedigree: First-, Second, and Third-Degree Relatives of Proband (EVAL-B)\n \u25caNCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal\n \u25caNCCN Guidelines for Gastric Cancer\n \u25caNCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors\n \u25caNCCN Guidelines for Thyroid Carcinoma\n \u25caNCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer\n \u25caNCCN Guidelines for Melanoma: Cutaneous\n\u0017Genetic testing with multigene panels should be reconsidered in those with prior negative tests with limited sets of genes.\n\u0017Consider referral for genetic risk assessment for patients who do not meet the criteria but who request it.\n\u2022 Consider referral to genetic counseling services for risk assessment and/or testing if the survivor did not have a comprehensive evaluation \nat time of diagnosis. \n\u2022 Genetic testing may also provide opportunities to identify and reduce risks in relatives of cancer survivors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a25d76fc-f7b7-40ba-8c46-63b63b06239a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a25d76fc-f7b7-40ba-8c46-63b63b06239a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0bde12c8-d84a-49a7-850c-3f0a08f4169f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "a9427775f41ff6e0932d4b17599fca7d6b81d8252ad4aab62bd6b1a4fe115e3e"}}, "hash": "a9427775f41ff6e0932d4b17599fca7d6b81d8252ad4aab62bd6b1a4fe115e3e", "text": ".\n\n\n\n\nSURV-6ASSESSMENT BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER (ONCOLOGY OR PRIMARY CARE) AT REGULAR INTERVALS\n\u2022 A periodic assessment at least annually is recommended for all survivors to determine any needs and necessary interventions.

For some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been \nassociated with a reduced risk of recurrence and death. \n\u2022 Cancer prehabilitation1,2 is appropriate for many newly diagnosed survivors prior to initiating treatment with surgery or chemotherapy. \nReferrals to physical therapy or exercise oncology specialists should be considered.\n\u2022 For optimal health, all survivors should be encouraged to set incremental as well as ultimate goals for diet, physical activity, and weight \nmanagement. At a minimum all survivors should be encouraged to:\n\u0017Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight throughout life (SNWM-2).\n\u0017Avoid inactivity.\n\u0017Engage in physical activity (eg, exercise, take the stairs, park in the back of parking lot) daily (SPA-1).\n\u0017Maintain a healthy diet high in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.\n\u0017Limit intake of red and cured meats and highly processed foods,a,b particularly those high in fats and sugars (SNWM-1).\n\u0017Drink alcohol sparingly if at all (SNWM-1). \n\u0017Discontinue use of cigarettes, other tobacco products (including hookah), and e-cigarettes (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation) .\n\u0017Practice sun safety\n \u25caUtilize a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 that protects against UVA and UVB rays and is water resistant.\n \u25caApply sunscreen generously and reapply every 2 hours or after swimming/excessive sweating.\n \u25caConsider using physical barriers whenever possible (ie, hats, shirts with sleeves, avoiding direct sun during peak hours).\n \u25caDo not use tanning beds.\n \u25caAvoid sunburns.\n \u25caSeek shade and wear protective clothing (ie, hats and long-sleeved garments) if outside for prolonged periods of time or during peak \ndirect sun hours.\n\u0017Strive for at least 7\u20139 hours of sleep on a regular basis (SSD-1).3\n \u25caYounger adults require more sleep.4\n \u25caTeenagers may require 9 or more hours of sleep.4\n\u0017Follow up with PCP regularly.\n \u25caAdhere to age-appropriate and treatment-associated health screening, preventive measures (SIMIN-1), and cancer screening \nrecommendations (NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, & Risk Reduction) .\n\u0017Obtain nutrients from food sources rather than relying on dietary supplements. Routine use of dietary supplements is not recommended \nfor the purposes of cancer control (SSUP-1).\n\u2022 A multidisciplinary approach (including but not limited to clinicians, physical therapists, dieticians, social workers, and patient navigators) \nshould be utilized to:\n\u0017Assess individual and community-level barriers to meeting the healthy lifestyle recommendations.\n\u0017Support patients in developing strategies to overcome challenges throughout the continuum of survivorship care (from diagnosis to long-\nterm survivorship). \n\u0017Consider specialty referrals to supportive programs offered by medical centers or the community (ie, Livestrong at the YMCA).\nFootnotes (HL-1A)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23b18d04-774c-432b-9feb-786cbd565530": {"__data__": {"id_": "23b18d04-774c-432b-9feb-786cbd565530", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9149ac0-e770-4e0b-b318-66a75e4c8e50", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "ee505066982d508ebdb707ca5cc2899c5cd541092a0b26e8927ab299bacb1892"}}, "hash": "ee505066982d508ebdb707ca5cc2899c5cd541092a0b26e8927ab299bacb1892", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Healthy Lifestyles\n\n\na Highly (sometimes referred to as \"ultra\") processed foods are made mostly or entirely from substances derived from foods and additives, with little or no intact food \n(eg, soft drinks, sweet or savory packaged snacks, reconstituted meat products [eg, sausage, chicken nuggets], prepared frozen dishes).

In the absence of known harm, administration of inactivated vaccines with the \nhope of achieving some protection may be worthwhile.

Vaccines may not trigger \nprotective immune responses in actively immunocompromised individuals or in survivors with residual immune deficits. In addition, certain \nvaccines such as those that are live attenuated (eg, measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) are contraindicated in actively immunosuppressed \nindividuals because of a proven or theoretical increased risk of prolonged shedding and disease from the live organism present in the \nvaccine; other live attenuated vaccines might also be contraindicated in survivors\u2019 close contacts. When other vaccine options exist, they \nshould be preferred over live attenuated vaccines in survivors (eg, recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]). \n\u2022 Ideally, clinicians should have administered all indicated vaccines to patients before initiation of cancer treatment (if possible, at least 2 \nweeks before cancer treatment).d\n\u0017Inactivated or recombinant vaccines should be administered 2 or more weeks before cancer treatment and 3 or more months after cancer \nchemotherapy. While this schedule is preferred, the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) can be administered during cancer treatment. \n\u0017Live viral vaccinese can be administered 4 or more weeks before cancer treatment or 3 or more months after cancer chemotherapy, but \nconsultation with an infectious disease specialist or physician familiar with vaccination in survivors and/or patients with cancer is strongly \nrecommended. \n\u0017COVID-19 vaccine is recommended as appropriate. See NCCN COVID-19 Resources: https://www.nccn.org/covid-19\n\u2022 In survivors who received anti\u2013B-cell antibody therapy, vaccination should be delayed for at least 6 months after chemotherapy and the last \ndose of such therapy.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNIZATIONS", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "503e703b-075b-4733-b90d-e332f242936c": {"__data__": {"id_": "503e703b-075b-4733-b90d-e332f242936c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0bba8141-5997-47bb-bd64-e1bb5d7f30cf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "add4b3379eebbaac488b813f277fa634a71a183853be460dbfad16ecc0ff4ab7"}}, "hash": "add4b3379eebbaac488b813f277fa634a71a183853be460dbfad16ecc0ff4ab7", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Immunizations and Infections\n\n\nSIMIN-2INTERVENTIONS\ne Vaccines Contraindicated or to Be Used With Caution in Actively Immunocompromised Survivors or In Close Contacts of Immunocompromised Survivors (SIMIN-A).\nf HCT includes peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and cord blood transplantation.\ng Safe pet care tips include washing hands with soap and running water after handling animal feces.

CVD-related comorbidity and mortality may detrimentally affect patients with \ncancer and survivors with short- and long-term sequelae. Counseling regarding cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle modifications are \nparamount in cancer survivors and patients with favorable prognoses. The risk of CVD-related death varies with years from diagnosis, with \nmost survivors being at greatest risk 5 or more years after diagnosis and completion of curative therapy.\n\u2022 Referral to a cardiologist or cardio-oncologist in patients at elevated CVD risk should be considered at any stage of the cancer journey .\n\u2022 Shared risk factors for both cancer and CVD (ie, smoking, poor health behaviors) contribute to the development of CVD and structural heart \ndisease or heart failure, a concept that becomes especially relevant to cancer survivors. Attention and counseling regarding shared risk \nfactors may improve cancer- and cardiovascular-related outcomes.\n\u2022 Cancer treatments (immunotherapy,a cytotoxic and targeted systemic therapies,b RT) can result in diverse cardiovascular issues, including \ncardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis after head and neck and mantle \nradiation, and cerebrovascular accidents.\n\u0017Survivors treated with anthracyclines are at increased risk for heart failure (SCARDIO-1).\n\u0017Androgen or estrogen deprivation therapy may elevate cardiovascular risk.c\n\u2022 Most CVDs (such as atherosclerosis) develop over time as a result of well-defined risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, use of \ntobacco products, obesity, and diabetes. Control of these risk factors can decrease the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. \n\u2022 Survivors should be assessed throughout the survivorship continuum for:\n\u0017Pre-existing and emerging CVD (eg, CAD, CHF, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation) and CVD risk factors \n(eg, hypertension, dislipidemia, obesity, cigarette/tobacco use, diabetes mellitus), with intervention for modifiable risk factors as necessary\n\u0017Cancer treatment history (eg, regimen/dose,b radiation field, dose/volume)\n\u0017Diet and exercise habits\n\u2022 Tools exist to help quantify atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk (eg, ASCVD risk scored).\n\u2022 Survivors should be counseled on any increased risk of CVD they may have based on prior treatment, comorbidity, or CVD risk factors and \non the ABCDEs of CVD Prevention (see Table 1 on SCVD-2).\n\u2022 Cooperation and shared care with primary care providers, and cardiovascular specialists as needed, is key to optimizing cardiac and \nvascular outcomes in cancer survivors. \n\u2022 Consider referral to cardio-oncology or a cardiology specialist for high-risk survivors.e\na Drobni ZD, Alvi RM, Taron J, et al.

This algorithm focuses specifically on heart failure or \ncardiomyopathy that may arise from anthracycline therapy. Other systemic therapies may also cause cardiomyopathy (eg, HER2-targeted \ntherapies), and some of the concepts presented in these recommendations may apply to these other cardiomyopathies. \n\u2022 Anthracycline-induced heart failure/cardiomyopathy may take years or even decades to manifest. Data suggest that signs of cardiac \ndysfunction can be seen prior to the development of symptoms. If detected early, anthracycline-induced heart failure/cardiomyopathy may \nbe responsive to cardioprotective medications, although prospective studies evaluating these medications are lacking.\n\u2022 Survivors may have risk factors that predispose them to heart failure. Some survivors may have structural heart disease (such survivors \nare considered to have Stage B heart failure) even if they have no actual symptoms. A history of anthracycline exposure is a risk factor that \npredisposes survivors to develop cardiomyopathyb (SCARDIO-3).\n\u2022 Having a history of anthracycline exposure plus additional cardiovascular risk factors increases the risk of developing cardiomyopathy and \nheart failure. It is encouraged that heart failure risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes be addressed in coordination \nwith primary care.\n\u2022 The risk for cardiovascular problems varies greatly depending on the type of anthracycline used and the cumulative dose received.c\n\u2022 For this algorithm, the panel has placed an emphasis on early recognition and prevention of clinical heart failure, as well as early treatment \nof patients at risk with appropriate cardioprotective medications to prevent cardiac remodeling over time. Therefore, for high-risk survivors, \nthe panel emphasizes the need for a thorough clinical screening for heart failure within one year after completion of anthracycline therapy .\naArmenian SH, Lacchetti C, Barac A, et al.

Clinical diagnosis of mental disorders immediately before and after cancer diagnosis: a nationwide matched cohort study in Sweden. \nJAMA Oncol 2016;1188-1196.\u2022 The NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management define distress as \u201ca multifactorial unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (ie, \ncognitive, behavioral, emotional), social, spiritual, and/or physical nature that may interfere with the ability to cope effectively with cancer , its \nphysical symptoms, and its treatment.\u201d The NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship complement the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management.\n\u2022 Survivors of cancer and its treatment are at elevated risk for mental health issues such as fear of recurrence, distress, anxiety , and \ndepression that may persist for many years after diagnosis.a\n\u0017Fear of recurrence can lead to increased symptoms when surveillance testing or follow-up appointments are scheduled and increased \nanxiety when physical symptoms occur that may or may not be similar to those experienced during the cancer diagnosis. \n\u0017Medical, psychosocial, environmental, and psychiatric health factors may affect the mood of cancer survivors and need to be considered \nwhen screening for distress, anxiety, and depression in survivors and deciding on treatment (SANXDE-6) . \n\u0017Recurrent worry, fear, thoughts, or images related to cancer events should be distinguished from obsessive compulsive disorders.  \nRepetitive, persisting thoughts, images, or behaviors or mental acts that a person is compelled to perform, aimed at reducing intense \nanxiety or preventing a dreaded event require psychiatric referral for evaluation and treatment.\n\u0017Monitor distress, especially at times of new diagnoses, transitions in care, cancer surveillance, significant loss, other major life events, and \nwith social isolation.\n \u25caSurvivors may not appear to be distressed and should be encouraged to inform their health care provider when they are feeling \nincreased distress, worry, anxiety, or depression. See NCCN Distress Thermometer Screening Tool (DIS-A)\n \u25caScreening for anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress should be a part of routine care. The panel recommends using validated \nmeasures such as the PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, PC-PTSD-5 for trauma (also see Trauma Screening [SANXDE-D] ), NCCN \nDistress Thermometer Screening Tool (DIS-A) , or PROMIS measures. \n\u0017Clinical assessments should include and evaluate psychosocial aspects of a survivor's background, including trauma (SANXDE-7) .\n\u0017Caregivers and all family members of the survivor, including younger children, are vulnerable to the same psychosocial stresses and \nsymptoms as survivors, though often at different times or for different reasons. If needs are observed, they can be offered resources and \nreferred for evaluation.\n\u2022 This algorithm is intended for oncologists and other health care providers to screen for distress, anxiety, and depression in cancer \nsurvivors, to provide steps for addressing these concerns with survivors, and to facilitate decisions about referral to specialists. \n\u0017The algorithm is not intended as a psychiatric diagnosis and treatment tool.\n\u0017The algorithm focuses on more common mood disorders after cancer. It does not screen or address treatment for psychiatric conditions \nsuch as bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, personality disorders, or obsessive compulsive disorders. Diagnosis and management of these \ndisorders should be done by a mental health professional (NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management).\n\u2022 Decisions about treatment and referral will depend on the acuteness of onset of symptoms, their intensity, and safety of the survivor and \nothers (SANXDE-6  and SANXDE-A ).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a7e4e2b-3ce0-4307-a506-4f0ae31c6e77": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a7e4e2b-3ce0-4307-a506-4f0ae31c6e77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "71c3e7c2-fa29-478b-8512-86cd86afcace", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "18c9a8753269ca68f8490ecfad980ae0b1f2aa63ed6bdb4d09e4e7cbacdd2a67"}}, "hash": "18c9a8753269ca68f8490ecfad980ae0b1f2aa63ed6bdb4d09e4e7cbacdd2a67", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Distress \n\n\nSANXDE-2b A positive response to any of the questions should result in further assessment.

However , many cancer survivors report that fatigue may be a \ndisruptive symptom months or years after treatment ends.\n\u0017Fatigue that initially presents months after the completion of adjuvant therapy or fatigue that worsens over this period warrants additional \nevaluation.\n\u2022 Fatigue is a subjective experience that should be systematically assessed using patient self-reports and other sources of data for cancer \nsurvivors in the months and years after diagnosis.\n\u2022 Patients and family/caregiver(s) should be informed that management of fatigue is an integral part of total health care and that fatigue can \npersist following treatment.\n\u2022 Medical care contracts should include reimbursement for the management of fatigue.\n\u2022 Disability insurance should include coverage for the continuing effects of fatigue.\n\u2022  Referral to rehabilitation services including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and physical medicine should be considered for \nsurvivors with fatigue in the months and years after cancer diagnosis.\n\u2022 Also see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71e6fa64-f3ef-48ad-961a-5a67b19fa27c": {"__data__": {"id_": "71e6fa64-f3ef-48ad-961a-5a67b19fa27c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "889d663e-c7af-4fbb-bf89-8a9d6a5e990d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "5c2d07a2a65c8095b1888f3bd29a1b3450c05b24975e98c0e0cb6462d14cdb77"}}, "hash": "5c2d07a2a65c8095b1888f3bd29a1b3450c05b24975e98c0e0cb6462d14cdb77", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Fatigue\n\n\nSFAT-2SCREENING\nScreen every patient for fatigue as \nvital sign at regular intervalsa\n\u2022 Severity: 0\u201310 scaleb \n(0=No fatigue; \n10=Worst fatigue you can imagine)  \nor \nNone, mild, moderate, severeNone to mild (0\u20133)a\nModerate (4\u20136)a \nor Severe (7\u201310)a\u2022 Ongoing reevaluation\n\u2022 Education and counseling on general \nstrategies for management of fatigue with \nan emphasis on continued surveillance\nSee Primary Evaluation (SFAT-3)\na Recommended screen and re-evaluation: \u201cHow would you rate your fatigue on a scale of 0\u201310 over the past 7 days?\u201d\nb Butt Z, Wagner LI, Beaumont JL, et al.

It can impact any area of the body (eg, arms, legs, face, trunk, groin).\n\u2022 Swelling on the same side as the cancer treatment is a universal symptom of lymphedema. Additional initial symptoms may include \nsensation of heaviness, fatigue, fullness or tightness in the skin, or pain. Symptoms including decreased range of motion or function and \nthickening of the skin may occur in later stages.a \n\u2022 Survivors who had surgery, radiation, or chemoradiation to the axillary, supraclavicular, cervical, or pelvic inguinal lymph node system are \nat risk for the development of lymphedema. Sentinel node biopsy also increases the risk of lymphedema, although it poses less risk than \ncomplete dissection. \n\u2022 BMI \u226530 kg/m2, localized infection, increased number of nodes removed, and higher initial extent of disease raise the risk of lymphedema \ndevelopment.\n\u2022 If possible, pretreatment limb measurement of both sides should be performed as a baseline for survivors with treatment-related or \nindividual risk factors, preferably by a trained lymphedema specialist.\n\u2022 Early detection/diagnosis and early referral are key for optimal lymphedema management because stages 0 and 1 are reversible, whereas \nstages 2 and 3 are less responsive to treatment. Therefore, survivors at risk for lymphedema should be regularly screened for lymphedema \nby symptom assessment, clinical exam, and, if available, bioimpedance spectroscopy. Patients should be educated about early symptoms \nand signs of lymphedema including fullness, tightness, heaviness, and pain.\n\u2022 Lymphedema may cause or exacerbate psychological distress (SANXDE-1) .\n\u2022 Survivors at risk for lymphedema and those with lymphedema are at a higher risk of localized infection in the affected area. These infections \ncan require hospitalization for IV antibiotics. Therefore, survivors with or at risk for lymphedema should be educated to inform their medical \nprovider immediately for signs of infection in the affected area.\n\u2022 Progressive weight training under supervision and physical activity are not associated with exacerbation or development of \nlymphedema.c,d,e\n\u2022 Observational studies have demonstrated that air travel, venipuncture, and blood pressure measurement (via arm cuff) are not associated \nwith exacerbation or development of lymphedema, and precautionary measures are likely unnecessary.f,g In the absence of high-level data, \nthe panel recommends medical procedures such as venipuncture and blood pressure measurements be done on the non\u2013at-risk limb; \nhowever, if necessary, procedures may be done using the at-risk imb.h More research is needed to determine the effect of these procedures \non the risk of lymphedema.\nFootnotes on SLYMPH-2A", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "794a93ef-d704-4283-b9be-2f96158ecf77": {"__data__": {"id_": "794a93ef-d704-4283-b9be-2f96158ecf77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f6572a5-fd63-4f41-a961-78a3dedca1c2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "6f0276c97c87a696376047ec45515b9f84956f2764342c2679a70ed5ddb3d2f5"}}, "hash": "6f0276c97c87a696376047ec45515b9f84956f2764342c2679a70ed5ddb3d2f5", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Lymphedema\n\n\na National Cancer Institute Lymphedema (PDQ)\u2013Health Professional Version: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/lymphedema/lymphedema-hp-\npdq.\nc Campbell KL, Winters-Stone KM, Wiskemann J, et al.

Consider referring to primary care \nservice for management of non-cancer pain.\n\u2022 Use a multimodality approach to pain management if those resources are available.\n\u2022  Non-opioid adjuvant analgesics are appropriate as primary therapy for many pain syndromes.\n\u2022  Non-pharmacologic interventions can be used as the sole treatment for pain, or as adjuncts to pharmacologic therapy.\n\u2022  Physical modalities (heat, cold, massage, acupuncture, physical therapy, or occupational therapy) are useful and should be considered for \nsome pain syndromes. \n\u2022 Opioid treatment is sometimes necessary, and the lowest appropriate dose should be used for the shortest amount of time possible.  \n\u2022  Psychological support of the survivor with chronic pain is necessary, and referral to psychosocial services should be considered for \nsurvivors in distress (SANXDE-1) .\n\u2022  Consider referral to a specialist for survivors who might benefit from further pain interventions. This could include referral to interventional \npain, physical medicine and rehabilitation, palliative care, pain specialist, urology, gynecology, orthopedic surgery, gastroenterology, or \nother appropriate consultants. \n\u0017If these resources are available, consider referral as early as possible during the course of treatment planning.\n\u2022 Opioids and pregnancy:\n\u0017Ensure appropriate opioid prescribing and screening for opioid use disorder (OUD) for survivors of childbearing potential. \n\u0017If a survivor on chronic opioids is pregnant or wants to become pregnant, do not stop opioids abruptly but coordinate further pain \nmanagement with the obstetrician. If the survivor has OUD and takes buprenorphine for addiction and/or pain, provide access to addiction \nservices without stopping buprenorphine. OUD can cause preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n\u2022 The panel acknowledges the legalization of medical marijuana for various conditions in multiple states.

Instruct caregivers to call 911 Emergency Service if \nnaloxone is administered.\n\u2022 Functional outcomes are important measures for patients on opioid therapy. The expected outcome (ie, improvement in function and/or pain) \nand terms of monitoring for outcomes, adherence, and safety should be clearly discussed with survivors and caregivers, agreed upon, and \ndocumented upon initiation and continuation of chronic therapy. Consider establishing pain treatment agreements/contracts in consultation \nwith state and/or institutional requirements. Pain treatment agreements can be a useful tool in the overall strategy to manage opioid use and \nlong-term pain in survivorsa (https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/SamplePatientAgreementForms.pdf ).\n\u2022 Re-evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and necessity of opioids at regular intervals.\n\u0017If the expected outcome is not achieved, other treatment alternatives should be considered. If opioids are no longer appropriate, \nrecommend gradual tapering of opioids to help avoid symptoms of withdrawal (see PAIN-G 3 of 13 in the NCCN Guidelines for Adult Cancer \nPain).\n\u2022 Address medical-related issues due to chronic or high-dose opioids.\n\u0017Endocrine/hypopituitary abnormalities\n \u25caTestosterone deficiency\n\u0017Manage opioid adverse effects (ie, constipation, nausea, pruritus, delirium, motor and cognitive impairment, respiratory depression, \nsedation) (see PAIN-H in the NCCN Guidelines for Adult Cancer Pain).\n\u2022 Monitor for aberrant drug-taking behaviorsb and for signs of substance use disorder (see PAIN-G 6 of 13 of the NCCN Guidelines for Adult \nCancer Pain).\n\u0017If there is evidence of aberrant opioid use, verbalize concerns to the survivor and refer as early as possible to pain specialist, palliative \ncare, physiatry, and/or substance use disorder/mental health specialists. \n\u0017Engage caregivers or people living with the survivor if possible. \n\u2022 The panel endorses the ASCO Policy Brief on Opioid Therapy and Access to Treatment (2016) , particularly as it relates to weighing the risks/\nbenefits of opioid treatment.\n\u2022

The survivor\u2019s goals regarding fertility and discussions regarding the risks of treatment-induced \ninfertility should be discussed and documented in the medical chart.  \n\u2022 Prior to initiation of cancer treatments, available options for fertility preservation should be discussed and/or referrals made to the \nappropriate specialists for those patients wishing to preserve fertility.\n\u2022  Fertility preservation procedures prior to cancer treatment are the most effective way to preserve fertility in cancer survivors. \n\u0017Fertility preservation procedures include in vitro fertilization (IVF) with oocyte or embryo cryopreservation, ovarian tissue preservation, and \nsperm cryopreservation. \n\u0017Data show that ovarian tissue cryopreservation is currently only about 40% successful. There is a much greater success with traditional \nIVF with oocyte or embryo cryopreservation.\n\u0017In addition to fertility preservation procedures, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists should be offered during chemotherapy \nto breast cancer survivors in order to preserve ovarian function. \n\u2022 If possible, reproductive organs should be shielded during RT.\n\u2022 If survivors have a change in their cancer treatment, the impact of treatment on potential infertility should be discussed again and/or \nreferrals made to the appropriate specialists.  \n\u2022  Once cancer treatment is complete, clinicians and survivors should not assume that the survivor is infertile, and survivors interested in \nfertility should be assessed by a fertility specialist.  \n\u2022  For survivors of breast cancer, pregnancy is considered safe and the hormonal environment associated with pregnancy is not thought to \nincrease the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Prior breast cancer treatment does not increase the future risk of congenital malformations. \nGeneral recommendations have traditionally been to wait until the survivor is disease free for 2 years before attempting to conceive, whether \nnaturally or via assisted reproductive technologies, because of the higher risk of recurrence within that time.   \n\u2022 For additional information regarding fertility preservation for patients with cancer, see:\n\u0017NCCN Guidelines of Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology\n\u0017NCCN Guidelines for Breast CancerPRINCIPLES OF FERTILITY1\n1 Oktay K, Harvey BE, Partridge AH, et al.

However, discussions about work are ideally best had before treatment begins so that treatment recommendations \ncan take work needs into consideration if possible. \n\u2022 Symptoms affecting work may wax and wane with a survivor\u2019s treatments or disease status, especially if they are living chronically with \ncancer or the consequences of cancer treatment. Some survivors might start and stop working more than once.\n\u2022 Most existing literature focuses on unemployment and/or those who do not return to work. However, underemployment and/or work \nlimitations due to cancer or side effects are also common.\n\u2022 Employment helps to protect survivors from financial toxicity and, at least in the United States, is frequently tied to health insurance access. \nThis can be a main reason survivors work even when/if they are not fully recovered.\n\u2022 Employment is an important source of personal interaction, normalcy , and social support. The psychosocial effects/advantages derived from \nwork may include a sense of purpose, emotional well-being, link to identity , improved quality of life, connection with others, and distraction.\n\u2022 Some populations are at increased risk for difficulties related to work (based on factors such as gender , age, race, ethnicity, cancer type, \ncancer stage, rural residence, educational attainment, etc). The increased difficulties in these populations are more likely for survivors \nwith physically or cognitively demanding jobs or jobs with limited flexibility in scheduling or tasks. Additionally, patients with cancer may \nexperience discrimination as a result of diagnosis/illness, and this may be a consideration for some individuals in decisions surrounding \nemployment.\n\u2022 Survivors should be offered information to help them understand their likely ability to work, take into account their finances and personal/\nfamily needs, and discuss potential work accommodations with their employers.1 \n\u2022 Clinicians should regularly re-evaluate work-related concerns post active cancer treatment or for persons living chronically with cancer .\n\u0017Periodically identify goals and barriers regarding work with survivor  (SWORK-3).\n\u0017A team approach may be needed. Consider early involvement of social work, primary care, physical therapy/occupational therapy, cancer \nrehabilitation, and/or career counseling services, if available.\n\u0017Employment disability forms are not typically well-suited to cancer . However, clinicians should consider the survivor\u2019s needs for flexibility \nin tasks and hours, and other workplace accommodations as a starting point for filling out the necessary forms.

\nThe number of cancer survivors in the United States increased from \napproximately 3 million in 1971 to more than 16.9 million  in 2019.1-3 This \nnumber is predicted to surpass 22 million by 2030.3 This striking increase \nis generally attributed to rising cancer incidence rates (mainly resulting \nfrom an aging population), earlier detection, a nd better treatment.  \nApproximately  64% of survivors were  65 years of age or older in 2019 .3 \nOnly 5% are younger than 40 years, and survivors of childhood cancer \nconstitute between 0.5% and 3.0% of the survivor population.4,5 In fact, an \nestimated 1 of every 5 persons older than 65 years is a can cer survivor.  \nThe most common cancer sites in the survivor population are breast, \nprostate, colon/rectum, and melanoma, together accounting for \napproximately 58% of survivors.4 Approximately 64% of survivors were \ndiagnosed 5 or more years ago, whereas 15% of survivors were \ndiagnosed 20 or more years ago, and approximately 5% have survived 30 \nyears or longer.4 \nUnfortu nately, many of these cancer survivors experience physical and/or \npsychosocial late and/or long -term effects of cancer and its treatment, \nwhich can be severe, debilitating, and sometimes permanent. Survivors \nmay be discharged from the care of their oncolog ist and feel isolated and \nscared. Furthermore, their primary care physicians (PCPs), who may now \nbe responsible for their care, often do not know how best to care for the \nspecific concerns and needs of cancer survivors.6 ASCO\u2019s statement, \n\u201cAchieving High -Quality Cancer Survivorship Care,\u201d cites a need for \nstandardized, evidence -based practice guidelines for the management of \ntreatment effects and heal th promotion of survivors.7 ASCO, NCCN, ACS, \nand other groups that are working in parallel hope to provide this \nguidance.8-12 The NCCN S urvivorship  Panel is comprised of a multidisciplinary panel of \nexperts  that includes at least one oncologist, bone marrow transplant \nclinician , gynecologist, urologist, infectious disease specialist , cardiologist, \nPCP, psychologist, nutrition scientist, nurse , epidemi ologist, social worker, \nand patient advocate. The panel has defined g eneral principles of cancer \nsurvivorship to help guide the reco mmendations that form the basis for \nthese guidelines .13 \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMetho dology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for  \nSurvivorship , an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed  to obtain key literature in the field of cancer survivorship , using \nthe following search terms : ((\"neoplasms\"[MeSH Terms] OR \n\"neoplasms\"[All Fields] OR \"cancer\"[All Fields]) AND (\"survivors\"[MeSH \nTerms] OR \"survivors\"[All Fields] OR \"survivor\"[All Fields])) OR \n((\"neoplasms\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"neoplasms\"[All Fields] OR \"cancer\"[All \nFields]) AND (\"survivo rship\"[All Fields] )). The PubMed database was \nchosen because  it remains the most widely used resource for medical \nliterature and indexes peer -reviewed biomed ical literature.14 \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types:  \nClinical Trial,  Phase II; Clinical Trial , Phase III;  Practice Guideline ; \nRandomized Controlled Trial ; Meta -Analysis ; Systematic Reviews ; and \nValidation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed article s and articles from additional sources \ndeemed as relevant to these guidelines  and discussed by the panel have \nbeen included in this version of the  section  (eg, e -publications \nahead of print, meeting abstracts) .

These \nguidelines are designed to provide a framework for the manageme nt of \nlong-term and/or late effects of cancer and its treatment. T he guidelines \nfocus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment \nof cancer can have on the adult survivor's  health,  physical and mental  \nstates, health behaviors, professional and personal identity, sexuality , and \nfinancial standing . \nThe panel acknowledges  that there is a growing population of cancer \nsurvivors with chronic cancer. This group includes those with incurable \ndisease who are receiving  systemic therapy  continuously  and those  who \nmay be  on treatment  intermittently. Although these guidelines do not \naddress the specific needs of survivors with chronic cancer (eg, \npsychosocial issues related to living for years with a terminal diagnosis \nand u ncertainty about the future; how to handle comorbid conditions and \ndisease prevention, screening, and treatment in the setting of limited life \nexpectancy; managing discussions around new drugs and early -stage \nclinical trials ),15 many of the recommendations in these guidelines are relevant to this population (eg, those around fatigue, anxiety, depression ). \nThe panel emphasizes that these guidelines may be used to guide the \nmanagement of all cancer survivors \u2013 not just those who have completed \ntreatment, but also the population with chronic cancer.  \nThese guidelines  should be used as a supplement to the follow -up \nrecommendations within the disease -specific guidelines (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site, available at www.NCCN.org ) \nand should provide a framework for the coordination of care between the \nsurvivor\u2019s health care providers to ensure that needs are appropriately \naddressed.  \nThese guidelines are not intended to provide guidance for the care of \nsurvivors of childhood cancer (detailed guidelines for the care of childhood \ncancer survivors are available from the Children\u2019s Oncology Group at \nhttp://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/ ). For survivorship issues related to \nyounger populations,  please also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent \nand Young Adult  (AYA) Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org ). For \nsurvivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune -\nmediated toxicities is warranted (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nManagement of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nFor this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Surv ivorship, the panel \nfocused on the preventive health issues including healthy lifestyle \nbehaviors, immunizations and prevention of infection, and cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD) risk assessment and modification . The panel also focused \non several common issues  of survivors: 1) anthracycline -induced cardiac \ntoxicity; 2) anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress; 3) cognitive decline; \n4) fatigue; 5) lymphedema; 6) hormone -related symptoms; 7) pain; 8) \nfemale and male sexual dysfunction;  and 9)  sleep disorders.

There are many types of survivors, including those living with cancer \nand those fr ee of cancer. This term is meant to capture a population of \nthose with a history of cancer rather than to provide a label that ma y or \nmay not resonate with individuals .\u201d16  \nThe Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment  \nFor some survivors, the consequences of cancer are minimal; these \npatients can return to a normal life after the completion of treatment. In \nfact, most cancer survivors rep ort being in good general health and \nexperience good to excellent quality of life.17,18 Also, a survey of 659 \nsurvivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers  found that a majority \ndo not suffer from psychologic morbidity or have a large number of unmet \nsupportive care need s.19,20 Other studies have similarly found that most \nsurvivors enjoy a high quality of life without a large number of cancer -\nrelated symptoms.21,22 \nHowever, many survivors do experience physical and/or psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment.23-25 Some sequelae become evident \nduring anticancer treatment (long -term effects), whereas others may not \nmanifest for months or years after active therapy (late effects).  The \nproblems can range from mild to severe,  debilitating, or even life -\nthreatening. Some problems are temporary or improve with time, whereas \nother problems are progressive or permanent. This topic has been well \nreviewed.18,26 \nA literature review suggests that at least 50% of survivors experience \nsome late effect s of cancer treatment.26 The most common problems in \ncancer survivors are depression , pain, and fat igue.27 The exact prevalence of various effects of cancer and its treatment are hard to quantify, because \nfew studies have addressed these issues in a longitudinal fashion, \ncomparing patients with and without a histo ry of cancer to differentiate \nbetween the effects of cancer and the effects of aging.18 In general, the \nprevalence of late effects in cancer survivo rs is believed to have increased \nover time, likely because anticancer interventions have become more \ncomplex and intense with combinations of surgery, radiation, \nchemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted biologics.28 \nPhysical Effects  \nPhysical effects of cancer and its treatment in cancer survivors include \npain, muscu loskeletal issues, fatigue, lack of stamina, urinary and bowel \nproblems , lymphedema , premature menopause, cognitive deficits, \ndiabetes, and sexual dysfunction.18,29 -32 The effects of cancer treatment on \nthe heart and bone are also well known.33-36 The type of physical effects \ndepends mainly on the treatment received. For example, radiation to the \npelvis can be associated with bowel, urinary , and sexual dysfunction  and \nincre ased risk for subsequent primary malignancies.37,38 The ACS  Study of \nCancer Survivors II  found that 38% of survivors reported at least one \nunmet need in the physical domain (eg , pain, sexual dysfunction).24 \nSubsequent  Primary Cancers  \nImportantly, t he overall incidence of subsequent primary cancers  in \nsurvivors is higher than in the general population  because of genetic \nsusceptibilities (eg, hereditary cancer syndromes), shared causative \nfactors (eg, smoking, obesity, environmental exposures, human \npapillomavirus [HPV]  infection), and/or the mutagenic effects of cancer \ntreatment.39-50 In fact, subsequent cancers accounted for 18% of all \ncancers diagnosed in the United States between 2009 and 2013 .51 \nTreatment -related subsequent primary cancers vary with the type and \nintensity of anticancer treatment and are associated in particular with \nradiation and specific chemotherapeutic agents.52-58 These subsequent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70012e7a-8d93-4bfe-b33e-3294e396379d": {"__data__": {"id_": "70012e7a-8d93-4bfe-b33e-3294e396379d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7807f5ac-2cb2-49b1-bd94-a2c563f903a3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "2c1e69a2ac198a55cfd8b79eeadd2229a64c6880797ace744687182189337cab"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc2faef4-616e-478f-835f-bef63a159821", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "4345821856382b4dd84cd8f0a13af2592194e0ca758a91451e568ea5cacaf2eb"}}, "hash": "90dc861731ec363231b48f07a76aadc0b94cac0dbeba8874c626c4d917b33dcc", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-5 malignancies are especially well studied in long -term survivors of \nchildhood cancers.59-62 Studies by individual cancer type show that the \nincidence of subsequent unrelated cancers ranges from 2% in survivors of \nmalignant lymphoma to 30% in survivors of small cell  lung cancer  \n(SCLC) .26 Another study of more than  2 million cancer survivors in the \nSEER database i dentified the highest risk for subsequent primary cancers \nin survivors of bladder cancer (34% at 20 years).63 Overall, this study \nfound that 8.1% of survivors of cancers diagnosed after age 18 years \ndevelop a subsequent malignancy within a mean follow -up of 7.1 years, \nwith 55% of these survivors dying as a res ult of the subsequent cancer.  \nScreening for subsequent primary cancers should be a shared \nresponsibility between primary and oncology care physicians (see the \nNCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, & Risk Reduction, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). In addition, lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of \nsubsequent primary cancers (eg, smoking cessation, physical activity, \nweight loss) should be encouraged.64 Finally, referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates, such as those with a cancer diagnosis at a young age or with \nmultiple primary cancers , to identify those with a potential increased risk  \nfor subsequent malignancies.65 Family cancer history should be \nperiodically updated to reassess hereditary risk, because it should not be \nassumed that all cancer survivors were assessed at diagnosis. Gen etic \ntesting guidelines and knowledge about hereditary cancer risk evolve over \ntime, and new family diagnoses may occur making periodic assessment \nimportant . Genetic risk assessment is appropriate for all survivors  of \nbreast cancer , epithelial ovarian cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, \npancreatic cancer, and colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed at age \n50 years or younger. Many other survivors of rare cancers, cancers \ndiagnosed at young ages, multiple primary cancers, or those  with one or \nmore relatives with the same or related cancers are also candidates for \nrisk assessment per guidelines from NCCN and other expert groups. Genetic counseling and testing is recommended for appropriate survivors \nbased on results of the risk asse ssment. Referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates when available to identify those with an increased risk for \nsubsequent malignancies. Genetic testing may also provide opportunities \nto identify and r educe risks in relatives of cancer survivors.

to an increased risk for cancer, as \nlisted above in these guidelines.  \nPsychosocial Effects  \nCancer can have positive effects on a significant portion of individuals, \nincluding strengthened relationships, a s ense of gratitude or \nempowerment, and an increased appreciation for life.66-72 Many survivors, \nhowever, experience p sychologic distress  after active treatment, and \nsome

effect on work status, \nperformance, and satisfaction.87 Survivors often take long breaks from or \neven leave their jobs during treatment, and returning to work after cancer \ntreatment can be critical to restoring normalcy to the lives of survivors. \nHowever, survivors may be left with di sabilities or late/long -term effects \nthat decrease their employment prospects or ability to perform at their \nprevious levels. Several studies have shown that unemployment rates for \nsurvivors are higher than for the general population.87-90 Furthermore, \nthose survivors who do return to work often encounter difficulties, such as \nphysical or c ognitive limitations, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and \nperceived or real discrimination.87,91,92 \nSeveral studies  have addressed factors that predict a delayed return to \nwork.93-99 For example, a French p opulation -based study revealed that \nclinical factors, such as severity of the cancer, receipt of chemotherapy , or \nthe experience of adverse effec ts, were associated with a delay in return \nto work.97 In addition, a systematic review of cohort studies found that \nsurvivors who were o lder, had a lower educa tion level, or had a  lower \nincome  were less likely to return to work.98 Another systematic review \nidentified factors related to the person ( eg, symptoms, coping, motivation), \nenvironmental supports ( eg, family, workplace), and occupation ( eg, type \nof work, job flexibility)  that impacted successful return to work after cancer \ntreatment.100 \nSome interventions to enhance return -to-work in cancer survivors have \nbeen studied (eg, psycho -education , physical training, vocational \ncounseling ), although additional research in this area is greatly needed .101-\n104 Multidisciplinary interventions that combine vocational counseling with \nother elements (eg,  patient education, patient counseling, behavioral \ntraining , physical exercises ) may increase rates of  return -to-work \ncompared to usual care.  Financial Burden  \nThe LIVESTRONG 2012  Survey found that approximately 33% of working -\nage survivors went into debt and 3% had filed for bankruptcy.105 The ACS  \nStudy of Cancer Survivors II  found that 20% of survivors reported unmet \nfinancial needs.24 A study in Washington state found that patients with \ncancer have a 2.6 -fold increase d risk of bankruptcy.106 In another study, \n38% of patients with stage III colon cancer reported financial hardship  \nresulting from cancer treatment, defined as  accruing debt, selling or \nrefinancing  a home, borrow ing money from friends or family, or \nexperienc ing a \u226520% decline in annual income .107 Another study found \nthat, in addition to the average >$16,000 excess economic burden  that \npatients feel in th e early phases of cancer treatment, survivors (>1 year \nfrom diagnosis) have an average annual excess economic burden  that \nexceeds $4,000.108,109 Much of this excess burden was because of excess \nmedical expenditures. A more r ecent study found that the excess annual \nhealth  care expenditures of cancer survivors averaged about $4400, and \nthat the t otal mean annual direct health care expenditure for cancer \nsurvivors  increased by about $1000 in the period from 2009 to 2010 to the \nperiod from  2015  to 2016 .109 Other recent studies also found  that cancer \nsurvivors have greater out -of-pocket expenses and are more likely to \nexperience material hardship than those without a history of cancer.110,111 \nYounger cancer survivors seem to be particular ly vulnerable to the \nfinancial effects of cancer.111-113 \nClearly, with lost wages and increased expenses, the fin ancial burden on \nmany cancer survivors is great. Recent data suggest that patients \nbelonging to racial and ethnic minorities are more  likely to suffer financial \nhardship after cancer treatment.114,115 Furthermore, the financial burden \nassociated with cancer treatment and survivorship can lower health -\nrelated quality of life , increase  psychologic distress, and impact adherence \nto prescribed medications.116-119", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18d40096-2939-4286-aec7-e0d93b0bf091": {"__data__": {"id_": "18d40096-2939-4286-aec7-e0d93b0bf091", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de7c069d-ddf9-4c0f-8ff1-93f42c3240e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "f6059c4a441fe49871271ba900b27f6e924d900bf6562452280c293b80d3e57c"}}, "hash": "5b7e74023cce1d8bef93e04291af520b5ed491dd3fc33b6639cdcabffc1971ed", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-7 Standards for Survivorship Care  \nIn 2005, the  Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now known as the National \nAcademy of  Medicine [NAM]) and the National Research Council compiled \na report  entitled , \u201cFrom Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in \nTransition. \u201d28 The NCCN Survivorship Panel adapted  the essential \ncomponents of survivorship care from the report:  \n1.

Assessment of late psychosocial , physical , and immunologic \neffects   \n4.

Cancer survivors with \nuntreated distress have poorer compliance with surveillance screenings \nand are less likely to exercise and quit smoking.120 A 2008 IOM report, \n\u201cCancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health \nNeeds, \u201d121 concluded that psychosocial screening and care should be a \npart of the new standard for quality cancer care and should be integrated \ninto routine care across the trajectory of cancer, which inc ludes the period \nafter active treatment . See the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management \n(available at www.NCCN.org ) and Anxiety and Depression  below for \nrecommendations on screening for and treating distress.  \nIn September  2011, the LIVESTRONG Foundation convened a meeting of \nexperts and stakeholders in the survivorshi p field to define essential elements of survivorship care.  After 2 days of consensus building, the \ngroup agreed on the following elements that all medical settings must \nprovide for cancer survivors, either directly or through referral \n(http://images.livestrong.org/downloads/flatfiles/what -we-do/our -\napproach/reports/ee/EssentialElementsBrief.pdf ): \n1. Survivorship care plan, psychosocial care plan, and treatment \nsummary  \n2. Screening for new cancers and surveillance for recurrence  \n3.

The current standard requires the \ndevelopment and implementation of a survivorship program directed at \nmeeting the ongoing needs of survivors treated with curative intent.

These include survivorship clinics \nwithin academic or community cancer centers, community survivorship \nclinics run by primary care clinicians, and survivorship care in the primary \ncare setting.125-130 In each case, survivorship care is delivered by either \nphysicians or by advanced practice clinicia ns such as nurse \npractitioners .131 Each model has advantages and disadvantages, and no \none model is clearly the best for all situations.  \nWith the population of  cancer survivors g rowing at a rapid pace, the \ndemand for follow -up care is expected to increase. An increasing \nproportion of this care will likely be performed by primary care teams. In \nfact, a systematic review identified specific needs of cancer survivors in \nthe primary c are setting, including psychosocial needs, cancer/survivor \ninformation needs, and medical need s.132 Because studies have shown \nthat primary care providers often do not know how best to care for the \nspecific concerns  and needs of cancer survivors,6,133 -138 education  for \nprimary health  care providers regarding appropriate survivorship care  will \nbe increasingly important.139 \nA study in the Netherlands found that patients with cancer 2 to 5 years \nafter d iagnosis increased their number of consultations with primary care \ncompared with age - and sex -matched controls without cancer by 15% for \ncolorectal cancer ( P < .05), 24% for breast cancer ( P < .001), and 33% for \nprostate cancer ( P < .001).140 These survivors also had mor e chronic \nconditions than controls. Although an American study using the SEER -\nMedicare database showed a smaller increase in primary care use by breast cancer survivors (10% increase in year 4 after diagnosis;  P < \n.05),141 these results show that PCPs are providing a s ubstantial amount \nof survivorship care. In fact, according to IOM analyses of the 2001 and \n2002 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital \nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey, approximately one -third of the more \nthan 36 million cancer -related visits to physicians\u2019 offices were made to \nprimary care.28 Furthermore, a nationally representative survey by NCI  \nand the ACS found that >50% of PCPs provide survivors with cancer -\nrelated follow -up care, often with co -management by oncologists.142 \nIn a survey of survivors regarding their preferences for follow -up care, \nmost participants said t hat the PCP should only provide care if the \nresponsibility was shared with the oncologist.143 One of the reasons \ncommonly cited for this preference was that surv ivors believe their PCPs \nlack the needed expertise to deal with their specific issues. In addition, \nsurvivors cited a desire for continuity of care. Additional surveys of \nsurvivors of breast cancer in the United States  and of survivors of breast, \ncolorecta l, and prostate cancer in the United Kingdom  found similar \npreference s for oncologist -driven follow -up care over PCP follow -up \ncare.144,145 Importantly, however, two randomized trials compar ing \nsurvivorship care administered by PCPs (provided guideline s outlining \nappropriate follow -up care ) versus  oncologists  found no difference in \ndisease -related outcomes, including survival.146,147 \nSurvivorship Care Planning   \nBecause primary care offices are in fact already caring for cancer \nsurvivors, it is critical for information to be shared between oncology and \nprimary care teams.

In addition, a trial in which 12 hospitals were randomized to usual \ncare or to patient -tailored , automated survivorship care plans found that \nthe receipt of a care pl an was associated with an increase in symptoms, \nconcern about illness, and emotional impact.156 No differences in \nsatisfaction with information or care  were  evident.  \nMore recent population -targeted randomized controlled trials are lending  \nsome support for the benefits of survivorship care planning. One \nrandomized controlled trial tested the role of survivorship care plans in 212 \nlow-income, predominantly Latina survivors of stage 0 \u2013III breast cancer.157 \nSurvivors in the  intervention group received the care plan  with a treatment \nsummary and a 1 -hour counseling session  with a  trained, bilingual, \nbicultural nurse who encouraged patient empowerment; the care plan and \ntreatment summary were also delivered to the health care p roviders  of \nsurvivors in the intervention group. Patient -reported p hysician \nimplementation of recommended survivorship care  (eg, for depression, hot \nflashes), the primary trial outcome, was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group ( P = .003).  Patient adherence to \nrecommended survivorship care , the secondary outcome, was also \ngreater for the intervention group, but did not reach statistical significance \n(P = .07).  Whereas this trial provides support for the benefits of \nsurvivorship care plans, it is impossible to separate the effects of the care \nplan and the intensive counseling session, and the applicability of the \nfindings to other populations is unknown. Another randomized controlled \ntrial examined the  efficacy of  mailing a personalized survivorship care \nplan, which was designed with qualitative input of hematopoietic cell \ntransplant survivors and briefly reviewed in a telehealth call by a trained \nnon-professional .149 The study randomized 458 hematopoietic cell \ntransplant survivors 1  to 5 years after transplant to receive the surviv orship \ncare plan or delayed survivorship care plan. After 6 months, the \nsurvivorship -care-plan recipients reported reduced cancer -specific distress \nand improved general mental health, although they did not report higher \nlevels of confidence in survivorship  information when compared with the \ndelayed care plan recipients as hypothesized.

This assessment can be done by the oncologist or \nPCP. Shared , coordinated care between the oncology , primary care , and \nsubspecialty care  provider s is encouraged.  Depending on the cancer type \nand stage of disease, transition of care to primary care may be done when \ndeemed clinically appropriate, with referral back to oncologic care as \nneeded. The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be \naddressed at every visit.  \nSome tools that screen for long -term and late physical and psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment in survivors  have been validated.171-176 \nIn addition, the NCCN Survivorship Panel  created a sample screening \ninstrument  that is guideline -specific and can be self-administered or \nadministered by an interviewer . This assessment tool was developed \nspecifically for use in co mbination with the NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship to help providers deliver necessary and comprehensive \nsurvivorship care.

Survivors \nundergoing certain treatments, such as mantle field radiation or certain \nsystemic therapies, may be at increased risk for subsequent malignancies. \nThose survivors who continue to smoke are at increased risk for smoking -\nrelated comorbidities and subsequent primary cancers.  \nReassessment  \nSurvivors should be followed and reassessed at regular intervals, \ndepending on the nature and severity of late and long -term effects being \ntreated . At each time point, assessment of disease status and ongoing \neffects of cancer and its treatment should be addressed. In addition, \nsurvivors should be periodically rescreened for the development of new \nlate and long -term effects of cancer and its treatme nt. The outcomes of \nany interventions for ongoing effects of cancer and its treatment should be \nevaluated regularly based on best practices and available resources. \nOutcome assessment may include survivor satisfaction with the \neffectiveness of the interven tion in reducing symptom burden, adequate \npain control, receipt of recommended immunizations and preventive care,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d3a19e7-2a61-47e0-be7e-9b6bea1c1875": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d3a19e7-2a61-47e0-be7e-9b6bea1c1875", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6befbb4c-13e9-4803-b211-b187113f22f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "fd3ceddfcb1323798cbd50ba3f1e2290aaef5fcae356d6415fcc80bb8c60795a"}}, "hash": "ae43579617ee94cf3767b015f2162a0880152c9a55b91d1aabc7d472183b1ace", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-12 and improved adherence to guideline recommendations for health \nbehaviors.  \nSurvivorship Research  \nThe IOM survivorship report  cites a paucity of  longitudinal cohort studies \nlinking specific cancer types or treatments with specific late effect s, \nmaking it difficult to predict risk for individual patients.28 Research is \nneeded to increase understanding of the prevalence of, mechanisms of, \nand risks factors for late and long -term effects of cancer and its treatme nt. \nIn addition, research is needed to better define interventions that relieve \nsymptoms, restore function, and improve the quality of life of survivors.177 \nFinally, research can help better define optimal follow -up and surveillance \nschedules for cancer survivors after treatment.178,179 \nAn ASCO survey report highlighted several key gaps in current \nsurvivorship research.180 For instance, more research pertaining to \nsurvivors >65 years of age, to survivors of cancers other than breast, and \nto long -term survivors (>5 years) is needed. In addition, research focused \non patterns and quality of survivorship care  is lacking. A study of NIH \nsurvivorship grants in fiscal year 2016 showed a need for research \nincluding more diverse cancer types, older and longer -term survivors, and \nmore ethnoculturally diverse populations of survivors.181 \nIn June 2012, the ACS , CDC, LIVE STRONG  Foundation , and NCI held a \njoint meeting and created an action plan to facilitate the translation of \nsurvivorship research into survivorship care.182 The plan is driven by \ncollaboration between researchers, survivors, clinicians, and public health \nprofessionals; the use of technology, such as EHRs; analysis of \ninformation from the vie wpoints of multiple stakeholders; and the \nintegration and synthesis of knowledge using systematic reviews and \nmeta -analyses.  Recommendations for Preventive Health  \nAnalysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  \n(BRFSS)  indicates that a  large proportion of cancer survivors have \nsignificant comorbidities, smoke, are obese, and/or do not engage in \nphysical activity.183 Analysis of data from oth er studies, including the \nNational Health Interview Survey , showed similar results.184-187 Separate \nsurveys by the ACS and the CDC  found that 9.3% and 17% of survivors \nsmoke, respectively.186,188 In addition, many survivors forego \nrecommended cancer screenings (ie, co lorectal and cervical screening) \nand follow -up surveillance189-191 or demand more intense surveillance than \nevidence sup ports.84 \nHealthy Lifestyles  \nHealthy lifestyle habits, such as enga ging in routine physical activity, \nmaintaining a healthy diet and weight, and avoiding cigarette/ tobacco use, \nhave been associated with improved health outcomes and quality of life. \nFor some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been associated with a reduced \nrisk of recurrence and death .192-199 In fact, the maintenance of a healthy \nlifestyle is associated with a decrease in premature death in cancer \nsurvivors.200 Therefore,  survivors should be encouraged to achieve and \nmaintain a healthy lifestyle , including  attention to weight management, \nphysical  activity, metabolic health, and dietary habits.  Setting incremental \ngoals for diet, physical activity, and weight management  should be \nadvised . Survivors should be counseled to limit alcohol intake and avoid or \nstop using cigarette/ tobacco products, with emphasis on tobacco \ncessation if the survivor is  a current smoker or user of smokeless tobacco \n(see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).201 Clinicians should also advise survivors to practice sun \nsafety habits  as appropriate, such as using a broad -spectrum sunscreen, \navoiding peak sun hours, and using physical barriers.

Although achieving all of these healthy lifestyle goals may be \ndifficult for many survivors, eve n small reductions in weight among \noverweight or obese survivors or small increases in physical activity \namong sedentary individuals are thought to yield meaningful \nimprovements in cancer -specific outcomes and overall health.202 Clinicians \nshould assess individual and  community -level barriers to meeting the \nhealthy lifestyle recommendations and support patients in developing \nstrategies to overcome challenges.  \nPhysical Activity  \nDuring cancer treatment, many survivors become deconditioned and can \ndevelop impaired cardiov ascular fitness because of the direct and \nsecondary effects of therapy.203 Randomized trials have shown that \nexercise training is safe, tolerable, and effective for most survivors. \nStructured aerobic and resistance training programs after treatment can \nimprove  cardiovascular fitness and strength and can have positive effects \non balance, body composition, fatigue, emotional well -being, and quality of \nlife.204-216 The effectiveness of exercise is especially well studied in \npatients  with early -stage breast cancer. Survivors of breast cancer who \nexercise have  improved cardiovascular fitness and therefore an increased \ncapacity to perform daily life functions, resulting in a better quality of \nlife.214,215,217 -219 Furthermore, a study of adult survivors of childhood \nHodgkin lymphoma  found that vigorous exercise was associated with a \nreduction in the risk of  major  cardiovascular  event s after a median follow -\nup of 11.9 years.220 In fact, the finding was dose -dependent, and survivors \nwho reported \u22659 metabolic equivalent (MET ) h/wk experienced a 51% \nreduction in risk compared with those reporting <9 MET h/wk (P = .002).  A similar study in patients with breast cancer found a similar reduction in the \nrisk of cardiovascular events  with \u22659 MET h/wk .221 \nIn addition, observational studies have consistentl y found that p hysical  \nactivity is linked to decreased cancer incidence and recurrence and \nincreased survival for certain tumor types.209,222 -239 For example, one meta -\nanalysis of 6 studies including more than 12,000 survivors of breast \ncancer found that post -diagnosis physical activity reduced all -cause \nmortality by 41% ( P < .00001)  and disease recurrence by 24% ( P = \n.00001).226 Data from other meta -analyses primarily consisting of \nobservational studies of survivors of colorectal, ovarian, non -small cell \nlung, brain, prostate, and breast cancers show that physical activity is \nassociated with decreased all -cause mortality and/or cancer -specific \nmortality.224,227,236,240 In fact, analyses of data from 986 survivors of breast \ncancer  from the National Ru nners' and Walkers' Health Studies  found that \nmortality decreased with increased rates of energy expenditure.237 \nEvidence in other disease sites is less robust, but also suggests survival \nbenefits associated with exercise in survivors after treatment.240 \nData also support the idea that inactivity/sedentary behavior is  a risk factor \nfor cancer incidence  and mortality and impacts mood and quality of life in \nsurvivors,  independent of the level of an individual\u2019s recreational or \noccupational physical activity.192,241 -247 For example, i n a cohort of more \nthan 2000 survivors of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, those who spent \nmore leisure time sitting had a higher  mortality than those who spent more \ntime in recreational activity.192 \nEvaluation and Assessment for Physical Activity  \nSurvivors should be asked about readiness for participation in and their \ncurrent level of physical activity at regular intervals. The Godin Leisure -\nTime Exercise Questionnaire  is one tool that can be used to assess a \nsurvivor\u2019s exercise behavior, with a mo dified version also able to assess \ndaily time in moderate -to-vigorous activity.248,249", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f2058ba-e873-4363-b449-cb873224ff40": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f2058ba-e873-4363-b449-cb873224ff40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5bdecb2-47e2-4fe8-9422-9cf13111e800", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "7e35f6ae4920210234ad96fa06496f186433e9dfc850956e019d53f8ed08e853"}}, "hash": "b9609bbdc0906f48a705c0728b086cf69faa68dd7f5f48226f56881cc62ea3f5", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-14 For survivors who are not meeting the guideline recommendations (see \nlater discussion), barriers to physical activity should be discussed and \naddressed, if possible. Common barriers include not having enough time \nto exercise, not hav ing access to an acceptable exercise environment, \nuncertainty about safety of exercise post -treatment, lack of knowledge \nregarding appropriate activities, and physical limitations.250 Alleviation of \npain, fatigue, distress, or nutritional deficits can facilitate the initiation of an \nexercise program.  \nRisk Assessment for Exercise -Induced Adverse Events  \nExercise is considered safe for most survivors .214,215,251 However, a \nsignificant portion of survivors may have comorbid conditions or risk \nfactors that make them unable to safely exercise without trained \nsupervision.252 Therefore, a risk assessment is required for all survivors \nbefore prescribing a specific exercise program.214,253 The type of cancer, \ntreatment modalities received, and the number and severity of \ncomorbidities determine risk levels.251 Thus, disease and treatment \nhistory, late and long -term effects, and comorbidities should be assessed. \nA standardized pre-participa tion screening questionnaire, such as the \nPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone  (PAR-Q+),254 can \nalso be considered to identify patients for whom unsupervised physical \nactivity is likely safe versus those for whom it may pose undue risk.  \nSurvivors with peripheral neuropathy, poor bone health, a rthritis , or \nmusculoskeletal issues  are considered to be at moderate risk for exercise -\ninduced adverse events. Stability , balance,  and gait should be assessed in \nsurvivors with peripheral neuropathy and possibly in survivors with poor \nbone health before they engage  in exercise , and exercise choice should \nbe made based on the results (ie, stationary bike or water aerobics for \nsurvivors with poor balance).  In addition, balance training can be \nrecommended for patients at risk for  falls. Moderate -risk survivors can \noften follow the general recommendations for physical activity; however, medical clearance and/or referrals to trained personnel such as a physical \nor occupational therapist, certified exercise professional , or rehabilit ation \nspecialist can also be considered.  Specialized training in working with \nsurvivors is available for both physical therapists and exercise \nprofessionals through the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM; \nhttp://www.acsm.org/get -certified ) and the American Physical Therapy \nAssociation (APTA) Oncology section ( http://oncologypt.org/ ). Survivors \nshould be encouraged to use an ACSM - or APTA -certified trainer when \navailable.  \nLymphedema is not a contraindication for physical activity, and no special \nprecautions are required for cardiovascular/aerobic exercise or strength \ntraining of unaffec ted limbs  (see Survivor Lymphedema Education, \nbelow ).255-260 Progressive resistance training under supervision is \nrecommended as part of treatment for survivors with lymphedema (see \nTreatment  of Lymphedema, above).  \nSurvivors at high risk for exercise -assoc iated adverse events include \nthose with a history of lung surgery or major abdominal surgery, an \nostomy, cardiopulmonary comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease [COPD], congestive heart failure [ CHF], coronary artery disease \n[CAD ], cardiom yopathy), ataxia, s evere nutritional deficiencies , severe \nfatigue, or worsening/changing physical condition (eg, lymphedema \nexacerbation). These survivors should receive medical evaluation and \nclearance prior to initiation of an exercise program and referr al to trained \npersonnel for a supervised exercise program.251 In general, exercise \nshould be individualized to the participant based on current exercise level \nand medical factors and should be increased in terms of intensity, \nduration, and frequency as t olerated.  \nPhysical Activity Recommendations for Survivors  \nBoth the ACS and the ACSM have made physical activity \nrecommendations for cancer survivors.212,261 In addition, the panel also", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e17ee6f2-9a74-4c64-b041-7ab26e7d80f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e17ee6f2-9a74-4c64-b041-7ab26e7d80f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34b1d84f-286b-4108-855c-3bc235f4b780", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "4c301cd05eb85bff12a50bf70f5f8cfd7c62ea0c60afad2a5398db663ecba538"}}, "hash": "8ec27f840d11cf39eb151c803fda2febf314c3d694e05682b466809feab80ee4", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-15 considered the physical activity guidelines for Americans published by the \nDepartment of Health and Human  Services (HHS)  and those on diet and \nphysical activity for the preve ntion of cancer by the ACS .262,263 The panel \nsupports the recommendations by these groups and has adapted them as \nfollows : \n1. Physical activity and exercise recommendations should be tailored to \nindividual survivors\u2019 abilities and preferences.  \n2. Survivors who are able should be encouraged to engage in daily \nphysical activity , including exercise, routine activities, and \nrecreation al activities .  \n3. All survivors should be encouraged to limit sedentary behavior (eg, \nsitting for long periods)  and return to daily activities as soon as \npossible.  \n4. Physical activity for cancer survivors:  \n\u2022 Overall volume of weekly activity should be at least  150 to 300 \nminutes of moderate -intensity activity or 75 minutes of \nvigorous -intensity activity, or an equivalent combination spread \nout over the course of the we ek; \n\u2022 Individuals should engage in 2 to 3 sessions per week of \nstrength training (see Resistance T raining , below) that include \nmajor muscle groups; and  \n\u2022 Major muscle groups should be stretched at least 2 days per \nweek  on days that other exercises are performed .  \n \nThe panel acknowledges that m ost survivors do not meet  these exercise \nrecommendations , and a significant portion reports that they perform no \nleisure -time activity.183,264 However, the evidence suggests that ev en light -\nintensity physical activity can improve physical functioning in survivors.265 \nFor survivors who are inactive, clinicians should not advise the immediate \ninitiation of a high -intensity, hig h-frequency program.266,267 Instead, the \npanel suggests that clinicians provide sufficient information to encourage \nsurvivors to avoid a sedentary lifestyle .253 Survivors and providers should work together to address barriers to physical activity and develop \nincremental short - and long -term physical activity goals. These goals may \ninclude increment al increases in time spent in physical activity or in \nintensity of activity over time. The panel suggested a possible initial \nphysical activity prescription (starting inactive survivors with 1 to 3 light -\n/moderate -intensity sessions of 20 minutes or more p er week), with \nprogression based on tolerance.266 For survivors tolerating the minimum \nguideline recommendations, clinicians should consider encouraging  \nincremental increases in time spent in physical activity or in intensity of \nactivity . Walking and using a s tationary bike are safe for virtually all \nsurvivors.  \nResistance Training  \nThe health benefits of resistance training include improvement in muscle \nstrength and endurance, improvements in functional status, and \nmaintenance/improvement in bone density. Core and strength training is \nimportant to maintain balance and minimize fall r isk.

Recommendations  for \nfood sources in a healthy diet are included in the guidelines. In general, a \nhealthy diet is rich in plant sources, such as vegetables, fruits, whole \ngrains, legumes, olive or canola oil, avocados, seeds, and nuts. Fish and \npoultry are recommended, wh ereas red meats should be limited  and \nprocessed meats avoided. Other processed foods and foods and \nbeverages with high amounts of added sugars and/or fats should also be \nlimited.  Other nutrition recommendations for survivors include eating a diet \nthat is a t least 50% plant -based, with the majority of food being \nvegetables, fruit, and whole grains, and tracking calorie intake. Self -\nmonitoring of caloric intake has been shown to be an effective strategy for \nweight management.352,353 \nIn addition, survivors should be advised to avoid alcohol, or if partaking, \nlimit alcohol intake to one drink per day for a 2000 -calorie daily diet  and \ntwo drin ks per day for a 2000 -calorie daily diet .212 This is especially import ant for survivors of liver, esophageal, kidney, and head and neck  \ncancers, who should refrain from alcohol due to an increased risk of \nmortality with alcohol consumption.341,354,355 Survivors of breast cancer do \nnot need to be advised to refrain completely from alcohol consumption, \nbecause it has no proven impact on outcomes, but should adhere to \ngeneral population recommendations.341,356,357 \nCurrently, no consensus regarding the role of soy foods in cancer control \nexists. Several large studies have found no adverse effects on breast \ncancer recurrence or total mortality related to the intake of soy food.358-362 \nIn fact, trends towards decreased recurrence and mortality were observed. \nThe panel therefore considers moderate consumption of soy foods ( \u22643 \nservings a day) to be prudent.  \nFor patie nts desiring further recommendations for dietary guidelines , a \nreferral to a dietitian  or nutritionist should be considered.

Survivors \nshould be advised that taking vitamin supplements does not replace the need for adhering to a healthy diet. If deemed necessary (eg, for survivors \ntaking multiple and/or or unfamiliar supplements ), referral to a registered \ndietitian, especially a CSO, should be considered for guidance in \nsupplement use.  \nHealth Behavioral Change  \nLifestyle behaviors are one area survivors can control if they are \nencouraged to change and are aware of resources to help them. \nAmbivalence about changing behavior is common in the ge neral \npopulation, but among cancer survivors levels of motivation are often \nheightened, especially close to the time of diagnosis.205,285,391  \nData suggest that recommendations from the oncologist can carry \nsignificant weight for patients with cancer , yet many pr oviders do not \ndiscuss healthy lifestyle changes with survivors.285-287,392 Print materials \nand telephone counseling are other strategies that may be effective for \nimprovin g healthy behavior in the survivor population, and several trials \nshow support for these strategies.289,296,304 -307,326,393 In fact, a  recent trial \nshowed that telephone -based health behavior coaching had a positive \neffect on physical activity, diet, and BMI in survivors of colorectal \ncancer.305,394 Moreover, results of the recently completed Reach Out to \nEnhance Wellness (RENEW) trial showed that an intervention of \ntelephone counseling and mailed materials in 641 older, obese, and \noverweight survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers not only \nresulted in improved diet quality, weight loss, and physical activity bu t also \nhad a long -lasting effect that was sustained a year after the intervention \nwas complete.289 The Exercise and Nutrition Routine Improving Cancer \nHealth (ENRICH) intervention , which includes 6  theory -based 2-hour \nsessions , has also shown a positive effect on physical activity, diet, \nweight, and BMI.395", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1d4d831-f134-4c46-9682-09f21f9a6e2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1d4d831-f134-4c46-9682-09f21f9a6e2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f6c0684-8fdf-4816-9816-0a5f5e245af0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "903e85f900d57b21da56f455d4362938d81f20b7c81bfe6c67c282c69a36f602"}}, "hash": "20034fa6ddb5ee131c21fa39de5fa673bebd206e6e664ec6c4eb40c4637959e1", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-21 Another strategy, motivational interviewing , may be an effective technique \nfor increasing physical activity and other healthy behaviors in cancer \nsurvivors.302,303 Motivational interviewing  focuses on exploring the \nsurvivor\u2019s thoughts, wants, and feelings and is directed at moving \nambivalence so survivors choose to change their behavior.396 Other \nbehavioral strategies may also be useful, such as improving self -efficacy \n(ie, the belief that one c an perform the actions of new activity and maintain \nthis practice by addressing barriers and planning for behavior change) and \nself-monitoring.397,398 Clinicians can consider referral to a provider trained \nin the techniques o f motivational interviewing.  \nImmunizations and Prevention of Infections  \nCancer survivors are at elevated risk for infection because of immune \nsuppression associated with previous cancer treatments, such as \nchemotherapy, radiation, corticosteroids, certain surgeries, and stem cell \ntransplantation. In fact, antibody titers to vaccine -preventable diseases \ndecrease after anti -cancer treatment.399,400 In addition, survivors are at \nincreased risk of complications from vaccine -preventable diseases, such \nas those caused by HPV and influenza viruses.400,401  \nMany infections in survivors can be prevented by the use of vaccines. \nHowever, data from the BRFSS found that 42% of survivors did not \nreceive an influenza vaccinati on in 2009, and 52% reported never \nreceiving a pneumococcal vaccination.183 Analysis of the SEER -Medicare \ndatabase showed that survivors  of breast cancer, aged  \u226565 years, were \nless likely to receive an influenza vaccination than matched non -cancer \ncontrols.141 A separate analysis of the SEER -Medicare database by \nanother group found similar results.402 \nVaccines represent a unique challenge in cancer and transplant survivors, \nbecause they may or may not trigger the desired protective immune \nresponses due to possible residual immune deficits.403-405 In addition, certain vaccines, such as those that are live attenuated (eg, zoster [ZVL, \nMMRV, or VAR]; MMR), are contraindicated in active ly \nimmunosuppressed survivors because of an increased risk of developing \nthe disease and/or prolonged shedding of the live organism given in the \nvaccine.  \nRisk Assessment and Screening for Immunizations and Prevention of \nInfections  \nSurvivors are at elevated risk for infections if their cancer treatment \nincluded chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab, \nalemtuzumab), radiation, corticosteroids, splenectomy,  CAR T -cell \ntherapy , and/or HCT (which includes peripheral blood stem cell \ntransplanta tion, bone marrow transplantation, and cord blood \ntransplantation). Risk is also elevated if the survivor has prior or current \nexposure to endemic infections or epidemics, or has a history of blood \ntransfusion.  \nInterventions for Prevention of Infections  \nInfection in survivors can be prevented by education, antimicrobial \nprophylaxis, and the judicious use of vaccines. For information regarding \nantimicrobial prophylaxis, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Prevention \nand Treatment of Cancer -Related Infections (available online at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nEducation  \nSurvivors should be educated about safe pet care, the avoidance of \nzoonosis, travel precautions, gardening precautions , proper hand hygiene , \nand avoidance of respiratory droplets  during a respiratory virus \npandemic .406-413 Contact with pets did not increase the risk of fever, \nbacteremia, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis in children with acute myeloid \nleukemia  (AML) ,414 and the panel believes that contact with pets is \ngenerally safe for most survivors.

The panel also notes that referral to other health care \ndisciplines/providers or community resources may be used to address \nseveral indications or identified issues with one intervention (eg, \nrehabilitation for fatigu e, depression, and pain).  \nCardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment  \nCVD and cancer are the two leading causes of death in the United States, \ntogether accounting for appro ximately 44% of deaths in 2017 .430 CVD is \nalso a leading cause of death in cancer survivors; for survivors of most cancer types, it is the most common cause of non -cancer death.431 In fact, \nsurvivors of most  cancers have a markedly increased risk of developing \nCVD compared with non -cancer populations.432-435 One reason for this \nincreased CVD risk in cancer survivors is that cytotoxic, hormonal, and \ntargeted systemic cancer therapies ( eg, HER2 -directed therapy, VEGF \nsignaling pathway inhibitors, cisplatin, anthracyclines with or without \ntaxanes, androgen deprivation therapy  [ADT] ) and radiation therapy are \nassociated with cardiovascular toxicities and can result in diverse \ncardiovascular issues, inc luding cardiomyopathy, hypertension, \nhyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and \ncerebrovascular accidents .436-444 In addition, shared risk factors for both \ncancer and CVD likely contribute to the dev elopment of CVD and \nstructural heart disease or heart failure in cancer survivors. These risk \nfactors include well -established and well -studie d risk factors such as \ntobacco use, obesity, and poor health behaviors, as well as recently \ndiscovered ones. For e xample, somatic mutations in blood cells cause \nclonal hematopoiesis  of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and increase the \nrisk of hematologic malignancies ; CHIP is also emerging to be an \nimportant causal risk factor for CVD .445 Other well -defined CVD risk factors \n(eg, hypertension,  hyperlipidemia, diabetes) are more common in cancer \nthan non -cancer populations.446,447 Most CVDs (eg, atherosclerosis) \ndevelop over time as a result of these and other risk factors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23095eff-d99e-4661-ac4b-bd9e7842f9ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "23095eff-d99e-4661-ac4b-bd9e7842f9ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1fba40d-7dc6-45ea-86cc-28c6e4ef72de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "657b66cc7443c113a0b6266d7f65a0d114788c9e243228616bfa4e3dae778e69"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffe101a3-0cd0-43b0-85c0-822d554b433c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "a948399dcd68666e094d0aa08942c0b570af5c4a63b5412d7b883c5b8e64d9de"}}, "hash": "f6a9619f80f7539a3fbb47b87ce58f9ad776ab2ab3fe865b286b644f7847aca7", "text": "Thus, the risk \nof CVD -related death varies with years from cancer diagnosis, with most \nsurvivors being at  greatest risk 5 or more years after diagnosis and \ncompletion of curative therapy.448 \nControl of CVD and shared CVD/cancer risk factors can decrease the risk \nof subsequent cardiovascular events.448,449 Data show that attention to and \ncounseling about CVD/ca ncer risk factors may improve cancer -

in these guidelines. Other systemic therapies (eg, HER2 -targe ted \nagents, angiogenesis inhibitors, immunotherapies) may cause \ncardiomyopathy or other myopathies like myocarditis,437,467,468 and the \npanel acknowledges that some of the concepts presented in these \nrecommendations may apply to these other cardiomyopathies. However, it \nis important to note that fewer data are available on the cardiomyopathies \nassociated with non -anthracycline sys temic therapies and that these \ncardiomyopathies may differ in nature from those induced by \nanthracyclines.437 More research is needed to understand the specific \nmechanisms of cardiomyopathies associated with newer agents. In \naddition, the panel emphasizes  that the approach to cardiomyopathy may \nbe different than the approa ch to other cardiac diseases such as CAD , \nwhich could occur, for example, as  a result of radiation therapy.469 \nPanel Considerations Regardin g Anthracycline -Induced  Cardiac Toxicity  \nAnthracycline -induced heart failure may take years or decade s to \nmanifest . Previous dogma has suggested that anthracycline -induced heart \nfailure portends poor prognosis and is not responsive to therapy. However, \nemerging data in heart failure due to other types of cardiac injury suggest \nthat signs of cardiac dysfunction can be seen early, prior to the \ndevelopment of symptoms.470 Additionally, data from these other types of \ncardiac injury suggest that early intervention with cardioprotective \nmedications results in better long -term cardiac function.471,4 72 It is possible \nthat if anthracycline -induced cardiac dysfunction is detected early, it may \nalso be responsive to cardioprotective medications.437,470 -473 In fact, data \nfrom a prospective study that followed 2625 patients who received \nanthracycline -containing therapy  through the survivorship phase suggest \nthat early initiation of heart failure therapy  may allow for at least partial recovery of LVEF  in this population.464 In this study, survivors were started \non treatment when LVEF decrease d by >10 abso lute points  and was  \n<50% . A full recovery was observed in 11% of treated survivors ( LVEF \nincrease d to the baseline value ), and 71% had partial recovery  (LVEF \nincrease d by >5 absolute points and reached >50% ). In addition,  a \ngrowing body of preclinical, observational, and pilot research suggests that \nlifestyle changes, such as weight control,474-476 dietary modification (either \nthrough correcting dietary deficiencies or increasing intake of various \nnutrients),477 and exercise,220,221,478 -480 may also  be helpful at these early \nstages, prior to the onset of heart failure symptoms, although more \nresearch is necessary.481,482 \nThese emerging issues in anthracycline -induced cardiomyopathy are \nconsistent with the changes in the cardiology community\u2019s approach to \nheart failure at large. C linical heart fail ure has established risk factors , and \nthe earliest signs of heart failure begin with the accumulation of these risk \nfactors over time , ultimately resulting in structural cardiac abnormalities \nand later symptomatic heart failure .

For these \nNCCN Guidelines for Survivorship, the panel emphasized  early \nrecognition of  cardiac toxicity  with the goal of preventing  the development \nof clinical, symptomatic heart failure  by addressing other known risk \nfactors for heart failure. In particula r, appropriate use of cardioprotective \nmedications , such as neurohormonal antagonists (ie, angiotensin -\nconverting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, beta -blockers), can be considered \nwith the goal of prevent ing cardiac remodeling over time  in some patients . \nIn this respect, the panel emphasizes a thorough clinical screen for heart \nfailure  for all survivors  with exposure to anthracyclines  after completion of \ntherapy , with the additional consideration of an echocardiographic screen \nin high -risk survivors, as discussed in more detail below . The panel also \nbelieves that early involvement of a cardio -oncologist or cardiologist in the \ncare of the cancer survivor is important. Therefore, there should be a low \nthreshold for referral to a cardio -oncologist or cardiologist. In addition, \nsymptoms of heart failure may mimic other conditions such as pulmonary \nissues and/or cardiac ischemia; therefore, a global approach may be \nnecessary when assessing survivors with decreased cardiorespiratory \nfitness.484 \nClassification of the Stages of Heart Failure  \nThe revised AHA/ACC classification  identifie s patients who do not have \nsymptoms associated with heart failure but are either at risk for heart \nfailure  (Stage A) or have structural abnorm alities of the heart (Stage B).483 \nThis revised classification has both diagnostic and therap eutic utility , \nbecause  evidence suggests that treatments prescribed in the absence of \nstructural heart abnormalities or symptoms can reduce the morbidity and \nmortality of heart failure  in the general population .437,4 64,470 -473 Left \nuntreated, however, the accumulation of cardiac risk factors leads to injury \nor stress on  the myocardium and generates a cascade of signaling events in the heart. The subsequent change in the geometry and structure of the \nleft ventri cle, often referred to as cardiac remodeling (Stage B), may \nmanifest as cardiac hypertrophy or chamber dilatation. In other cases, the \nresult may be decreased cardiac contractility , which can result in \ndecrease d LVEF (also Stage B) . Cardiac remodeling gene rally precedes \nthe development of  symptoms (by months or even years), continues  after \nsymptoms  become evident , and contributes substantially  to symptom  \nprogression  and mortality despite treatment.  Individuals are considered to \nhave Stage C heart failure wh en clinical signs and symptoms accompany \nstructural changes to the heart. Stage D is the most advanced stage, with \npatients showing advanced structural heart disease and significant heart \nfailure symptoms at rest that are refractory to medical therapy; the se \npatients require specialized interventions.  \nThe panel also considered the New York Heart Association\u2019s (NYHA) \nfunctional classification of heart failure.485 In this system, which is based \non limitations to physical activity and the effect of physical activity on heart \nfailure symptoms,  NYHA Class I is similar to AHA/ACC Stage B, while \nNYHA Class II and III would be considered AHA/ACC Stage C and NYHA \nClass IV is similar to AHA/ACC Stage D.  \nAssessment for Anthracycline -Induced Cardiac Toxicity  \nThe panel recognizes a lack of high -quality data to inform the benefits of

discussed,488 and, \nunfortunately, high -quality data have not been forthcoming since ASCO\u2019s \n2007 review.  \nIn the absence of data, the Children\u2019s Oncology Group relied on the

conclusion of treatment and \nthen every 1 to 5 years for life depending on age at treatment, \nanthracycline dose, and chest irradiation \n(http://www.survivorshipguidelines.org ). An international collaborative \nsupports lifelong echocardiograph ic surveillance at least every 5 years in \nsurvivors of childhood cancer treated with anthrac yclines .489 Although the \nfrequency of cardiac assessment using echocardiograms or multigated \nacquisition ( MUGA ) scans in this population has been a matter of debate, \nthere is general support for at least one assessment in children who have \ncompleted anthracycline thera py.490,491 \nA 2014 joint expert consensus statement from the American Society of \nEchocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular \nImaging  recommends  yearly cardiovasc ular assessment  of adult survivors \nafter the completion of potentially cardiotoxic therapy to look for early \nsigns and symptoms o f CVD , with cardiac imaging used at the discretion \nof the clinician.492 The groups recommen d echocardiogra m as the \npreferred imaging modality, when imaging is performed. The report also \nacknowledged the limited data available  to inform their recommendations.  \nIn 2017, ASCO released a c linical practice guideline  for the prevention and \nmonitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult cancers.493 The \nASCO panel gave a moderate -strength recommendation (as based on evidence and the balance between harms and benefits) that \nechocardiogram can be performed for asymptomatic survivors deemed to \nbe at increased risk for  cardiac dysfunction at 6 to 12 months after \ntreatment, including survivors with a history of anthracycline therapy. \nInsufficient evidence prevented the ASCO panel from making a \nrecommendation regarding the frequency and duration of additional \nsurveillance  of survivors who are asymptomatic and who showed no signs \nof cardiac dysfunction on initial assessment.  \nThe NCCN Survivorship Panel defined its screening recommendations \nbased largely on consensus and on the idea that early recognition and \ntreatment of ca rdiotoxicity can allow for earlier interventions that may \nimprove prognosis (discussed below).  \nAssessment for Symptoms of Heart Failure  \nAccording to the 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines, the cardinal manifestations of \nclinical heart failure (Stage C) include dyspne a and fatigue (which may \nlead to limited exercise tolerance) or fluid retention (which may lead to \npulmonary and peripheral edema).494 These symptoms  can lead to \ndecreased functional capacity and affect quality of life. Heart failure \nsymptoms associated with fluid retention may also include orthopnea or \nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

Furthermore, the oncologic history of the survivor \nshould be revi ewed. Chest radiation can increase the risk of ischemic \ncardiac disease, which can contribute to heart failure.436,442,448,495 The \naddition of other cardiotoxic therapies (eg, HER2 -targeted agents) to \nanthracyclines can further incr ease the risk of heart failure over that seen \nwith the use of anthracyclines alone.496 Older survivors, those w ith a \nhigher cumulative anthracycline dose  (cumulative doxorubicin dose of 250 \nmg/m2 or equivalent497), those with underlying CVD  or risk factors, and \nthose who had a low -normal (50% \u201354%) baseline ejection fraction are \nalso at increased risk for the development of heart failure. Recent data \nalso showed that being o verweight or obes e and v isceral and \nintramuscular adiposity  are risk factors  for cardiotoxi city from \nanthracyclines  in breast cancer survivors.498,499 In addition, the risk of \ncardiac events and death  in survivors of breast cancer has been shown to \nincrease as the number of cardiovascular risk factors increases.500  \nImaging  \nWhen developing these imaging guidelines for screening for cardiac \ntoxicity in survivors with a history of anthracycline exposure, the panel \nconsidered several questions: 1) Is the prevalence of structural heart \ndisease h igh enough to warrant screening of anthracycline -treated \nsurvivors ?; 2) Is an abnormal echocardiogram post -anthracycline therapy \nassociated with  an increased risk  for the future development of \nsymptomatic heart failure ?; and 3) Does the recognition of  cardiac \nabnormalities  and treatment  of cardiac risk factors  post-anthracycline \ntherapy  affect outcomes ? \nAs for the prevalence of structural heart disease in patients treated with \nanthracyclines, a  study of 2625 patients with cancer (mostly breast cancer or non -Hodgkin lymphoma) assessed LVEF be fore, every 3 months during \nanthracycline chemotherapy and during the following year, every 6 months \nfor the next 4 years, and annual after that.464 Cardiotoxicity, defined as \nLVEF  <50%  and decreas ed by >10 absolute points, was observed in 9% \nof the study population. In the large randomized controlled NSABP B -31 \ntrial, cardiac function was assessed by cardiac imaging in patients after \ninitial anthracycline -based therapy as a requirement for further treatment \nwith trastuzumab.501 Over 7% of patients experienced cardiac symptoms \nand/or a decrease in LVEF of >15% after receiving anthracyclines, thus \nexcluding them from being considered for trastuzumab. It is important to \nnote that this was a clinical trial patient population without significant \ncardiac risk factors or history of cardiac disease. In a non -clinical trial \npopulation of patients with cancer, many may already have cardiac risk \nfactors or actual cardiomyopathy pr ior to treatment, thus elevating the risk \nof developing heart failure. Together, these results indicate that a \nsignificant proportion of survivors with early -onset Stage B or greater heart \nfailure can be identified with appropriate imaging after therapy. H owever, it \nis not clear that these declines in LVEF after anthracycline therapy were \nassociated with an increased risk of developing subsequent heart failure.  \nRegarding the second question, little is known regarding the natural \nhistory of heart failure in survivors with  Stage B heart failure  post-\nanthracycline therapy , and  the long -term prognosis of survivors with \ncardiac structural abnormalities following anthracycline exposure is not \nknown .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b29e9b8-57f5-41a6-a2c6-4984cb55ce86": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b29e9b8-57f5-41a6-a2c6-4984cb55ce86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0873b01e-370a-40d8-b4d8-b11a6f41167b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "1eb1e56813e1ed0c3332f7732c557433688e574e165256031fa0bf74be2838b9"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3c5a506-fa7d-458a-aa54-d53542f71dd0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "60f1be6ac8f310e24c278896e6a28159b66bef91e317ce58e42dab122731e470"}}, "hash": "5eb49757fe77fd624541ae9d71fa3df6b22b8aa749cccc769ae543a4f5f48d2a", "text": "However , regarding the final question, limited evidence suggests \nthat further remodeling of the heart may be able to be mitigated by \ninitiation of cardioprotective medications.

Injury or stress on the myocardium (such as during and after \ntreatment with anthracyclines) can lead to activation of endogenous \nneurohormonal systems, which play a critical role i n cardiac remodeling \nand therefore progre ssion to Stage B heart failure.  \nThe panel recommends that heart failure risk factors, including \nhypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome , and diabetes , be addressed in \nall survivors  who have completed anthracycline  therapy . In addition, \nsurvivors with a history of anthracycline therapy should be advised to  \nengage in regular physical activity, eat a healthy diet, and avoid behaviors \nthat may increase the risk of heart failure or CVD  (eg, cigarette/ tobacco or \nillicit drug use). Physical activity has been shown to improve control of \nhypertension and to slow cardiac remodeling in breast cancer survivors \nwith heart failure.507 Involvement of the survivor\u2019s primary care provider in \nmanaging risk factors is encouraged.  \nThe panel recommends that a low threshold be established for referral to a \ncardio -oncologist or cardiologist for all patients previously treated with an \nanthracycline. Additional recommendations for each sta ge of heart failure \nare discussed below.  Treatment of Stage A Heart Failure  \nStage A heart failure recognizes several well -established risk factors , each \nof which contribute to early stage s of heart failure. These include \nhypertension, CAD , diabetes mellitus, a family history of heart failure , or a \nhistory of cardiotoxins such as anthracyclines. Therefore, all survivors  with \nexposure to anthracyclines have, by definition, at least one risk factor that \npredisposes them to cardiac disease  and s hould be treated  as \nappropriate. Other anti -cancer systemic therapies are potentially \ncardiotoxic and may increase the risk of cardiac disease.439 Involvement of \nthe survivor\u2019s PCP in the management of survivors with cardiac risk \nfactors is encouraged. Management can include addressing under lying \nrisk factors, recommending physical activity and healthy dietary habits, \nand referral to a cardiologist.  \nTreatment of Stages B, C, and D Heart Failure  \nThe panel recommends referral to a cardiologist for all survivors with \nStages B, C, or D heart fail ure.

Safety Evaluation  \nCancer survivors with anxiety, depression, PTSD, or another psychiatric \ndisorder that is impacting quality of life should undergo a safety evaluation \nto assess whether they are a danger to themselves or others.535 Risk \nfactors to assess include previous attempts at suicide or self -injury, a \nfamily history or other exposure to suicide, not having a spouse or live -in \npartner, social isolation, and other factors that suggest difficulty with \nsevere stress . These include perceiving oneself as a burden, recent loss \nof an important person, a relationship breakdown, chronic illness or recent \nchange in health status, alcohol or other substance abuse, loss of rational \nthinking, feeling hopelessness or loss of co ntrol, financial instability, and \naccess to firearms/weapons or potentially lethal medications ( eg, opioids, \nbenzodiazepines [BZDs], antidepressants). Males and those in their late \nteens or age >55 years are also at elevated safety risk. Medical risk \nfacto rs should also be  assessed , including the presence of a sleep \ndisorder, which has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of \nsuicide.536 \nProtective factors also should be considered to balance against risk \nfactors.535 Survivors who are married, have child -rearing responsibilities, \nand/or are employed are less  likely to pose a danger to themselves or \nothers. In addition, survivors with strong interpersonal bonds to family or \ncommunity, who identify reasons for living, or with cultural, spiritual, and \nreligious beliefs about the meaning and value of life are at lower risk. The \npanel lists additional protective factors in the algorithm above.  \nSurvivors with suicidal or homicidal thoughts or a plan  and/or with multiple \nother risk factors are at an elevated risk of danger to themselves or others. \nIn addition, the in ability of the survivor to care for themsel f may also \nindicate an elevated safety risk.

The mission of ICCTF is to advance \nunderstanding of the impact of cancer and cancer -related treatment on \ncognitive and behavioral functioning in patients with C NS and non -CNS \ncancers.632 The group published recommendations regarding \nneuropsychological testing, defining cognitive impairment /changes, \nneuroimaging, and future study design.631,633 \nThese NCCN Guidelines address cognitive function of survivors with non -\nCNS malignancies who did not have CNS -directed therapies.  Assessment and Evaluation for Cognitive Dysfunction  \nPatients who report cognitive impairment should be screened for \npotentially reversible factors that may contribute to cognitive impairment, \nincluding depression, pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Some  \nmedications can also contribute to cognitive impairment. Therefore, \ncurrent medications, including over -the-counter medications and \nsupplements, should be reviewed.  \nFor those who present with concomitant focal neurologic deficits and those \nwhose symptoms  evolve to include these findings, imaging is indicated to \nrule out structural abnormalities  (ie, brain or CNS disease). In addition, \nimaging in the absence of focal findings may be appropriate for patients \ndeemed to be at high risk for recurrence or metas tatic disease involving \nthe CNS.  \nUnfortunately, no effective brief screening tool for cancer -associated \ncognitive dysfunction in the asymptomatic cancer survivor currently exists. \nThe Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE634) and similar screening tools \nlack adequate sensitivity  to detect the subtle decline in cognitive \nperformance seen in most cancer survivors. Instead, the panel listed \nseveral questions that can help clarify the nature of the impairment, \nincluding inquiries about the ability to pay attention, find words, rememb er \nthings, think clearly, and perform functions. The time of onset of symptoms \nand the trajectory over time should also be assessed.  \nManagement of Cognitive Dysfunction  \nSurvivors benefit from validation of their symptom experience and should \nbe reassured t hat, in most survivors, cognitive dysfunction does not \nworsen over time. In fact, data from breast cancer survivors suggest that \nsymptoms may improve over time.585 The panel recommends the use of \nnonpharmacologic interventions whenever possible, with pharmacologic \ninterventions as a last line of therapy in survivors for whom other \ninterventions have been insufficient, as discussed in the following", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71f082e3-ae7f-40fa-8336-4cdfd25bb196": {"__data__": {"id_": "71f082e3-ae7f-40fa-8336-4cdfd25bb196", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "742b6cf9-ddc8-4b44-928c-0e78c62b662b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "a4a7212881069d9f86ae0712a5c6d61e2afe61a63b415e7b8cb60b1245a519ce"}}, "hash": "6133a0539d81da3fea05088ca306ee13b959744b08fe0dd143f9b607aee9e91f", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-38 sections.

Practical suggestions include instruction \nin self -management and coping strategies (eg, using planners, reminder \nnotes, and/or smart phone technology; keeping items in the same place), \nwhich the panel believes can be very helpful to patients. Discontinuation or \nlimitation of use of medications known to cause or contribute to cognitive \nimpairment should be attempted. Management of depression/emotional \ndistress, pain, sleep disturbances, and fatigue should be provided. In fact, \na study showed that CBT for fatigue was e ffective at reducing self -\nreported cognitive disability and concentration problems in 98 severely \nfatigued cancer survivors  randomized to CBT compared with those \nrandomized to a wait list.635 However, no difference in neuropsychological \ntest performance  was observed.  \nCBT for cognitive dysfunction may also help some survivors. In one small \nstudy, CBT was evaluated in 40 breast cancer survivors using a waitlist \ncontrol trial design.636 Although overall quality of life improved with the \nintervention, statistically significant improvement was noted only with \nverbal memory, not with self -reports of daily cognitive complaints. Ano ther \nstudy of CBT delivered by video conference in 47 survivors of breast \ncancer found that CBT led to improvements in self-reported  cognitive \nimpairment  and in neuropsychological processing speed  compared with \nsupportive therapy.637 \nRoutine physical activity should be encouraged. Substantial evidence \nshows that physical activity enhances cognitive function in elderly people \nin general, although only few studies specific to cancer survivors have been repor ted.638-642 A small randomized controlled trial  of an exercise \nintervention versus control in breast cancer survivors evaluated objective \nand self -reported cognition.642 The exercise intervention significantly \nimproved processing speed among those who had been diagnosed within \nthe past 2 years , but no other significant differences were observed . \nCognitive training (ie, brain games)  can also be considered. Cognitive \ntraining has demonstrated benefits in self -reported and objectively \nassessed cognitive function, including memory, executive function, and \nverbal function .639,643 One study randomized 157 breast cancer survivors \nto web-based cognitive training with telephone support or to wait-list \ncontrol .644 Verbal learning and results on a working memory test showed \nstatistically significant improvement in the cognitive training group, but no \nimprovements were seen for an objective measure of working memory \nand a measure of perceived cognitive functioning . Another study used a 5 -\nsession, small -group intervention of psychoeducation and cognitive \nexercises  in 48 breast cancer survivors.645 Compared to survivors \nrandomized to a wait -list control group, survivors in the intervention arm \nexperienced i mprovements in self -reported cognit ive complaints and \nmemory functioning on neurocognitive testing .

Identificati on and management of fatigue remain an \nunmet need for many cancer survivors.  \nThe specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of cancer -\nrelated fatigue are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include pro -\ninflammatory cytokines, hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis \ndysregulation, circadian rhythm desynchronization, skeletal muscle \nwasting, and genetic dysregulation.681-686 Several studies have focused on \nthe cause of fatigue, especially in cancer survivors with no evidence of \nactive disease, and have su ggested that persistent immune system \nactivation and chronic inflammatory processes may be involved.666,687 -689 \nEvidence supporting these mechanisms is limited.  \nScreening for Fatigue  \nAll survivors should be screened for fatigue to ensure that those with \nmoderate to severe fatigue are identified and treated promptly and \neffectively. Because fatigue is a subjective experience, clinicians must rely \non patients\u2019 descriptions of their fatigue level. The panel recommends the \nuse of a severity scale, with survivors being asked, \u201cHow would you rate \nyour fatigue on a scale of 0 t o 10 over the past 7 days?\u201d Alternatively, screening can be performed with patients asked to rate their fatigue as \nnone, mild, moderate, or severe. Scores of 0 to 3 or none to mild fatigue \nrequire no further assessment or interventions; these patients shou ld be \nrescreened at regular intervals. Patients with scores of 4 or greater or \nindicating moderate or severe fatigue should be evaluated further. Studies \nin patients with cancer have revealed a marked decrease in physical \nfunctioning at a reported fatigue level of 7 or higher on the 0 to 10 \nscale.690,691 \nEvaluation for Moderate to Severe Fatigue  \nWhen fatigue is rated as moderate to severe, with a score of 4 to 10, a \nmore focused history and physical examination should be conducted. A \nthorough history is warranted, because the recommended workup for \nfatigue differs according to the timing of fatigue onset in relation to the \ncompletion of active therapy and the presence of predisposing factors and \nother symptoms. Fatigue has a variable natural history, with some patients \ncomplain ing of only mild levels of fatigue even during active therapy and \nothers experiencing severe fatigue for years after treatment completion.  \nIn general, mild to moderate levels of fatigue that persist for 6 to 12 \nmonths after the completion of therapy do not warrant an extensive \nworkup, unless other symptoms are present. Conversely, when moderate \nto severe fatigue begins after or worsens during  this period, or when other \nsymptoms are present, such as pain, pulmonary complaints, or \nunintentional weight loss, a more extensive workup is warranted to screen \nfor the presence of metastatic disease or other comorbidities. Refer ral to a \npulmonologist should be made for pulmonary complaints . \nRegardless of fatigue onset, it is always relevant to screen for common \ncontributing factors such as emotional distress, sleep disturbance, pain, \nand the use of prescriptions or over -the-counter medications or \nsupplem ents.

For additional information about fatigue in survivors and \npatients with cancer, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer -Related \nFatigue (available at www.NCCN.org ). These guidelines may be modified \nto fit the individual survivor\u2019s circumstance s. \nTreatment of Contributing Factors  \nManagement of fatigue in survivors first includes the treatment of \ncontributing factors such as pain, distress, anemia, and sleep disturbances \n(more information on  the treatment of pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep \ndisorders in survivors can be found throughout these guidelines). In a \nrandomized controlled trial of 152 fatigued patients with advanced cancer, \ntreatment of accompanying physical symptoms, including pain, nausea, \nvomiting, and shortness of breath, resulted  in a significantly higher impact \non general fatigue, activity, and motivation than usual care.692 \nPatient and Family Education and Counseling  \nEducation and counseling can be beneficial in helping patients cope with \nfatigue. Understanding typical patterns of fatigue during and after \ntreatment can help patients set reasonable expectations regarding \nimprovements in energy after the completion of can cer therapy and can \nhelp allay concerns that persistent fatigue after the completion of therapy \nis evidence of disease recurrence. Counseling can help patients develop \nstrategies for self -monitoring of fatigue and techniques such as energy conservation tha t may be helpful in the immediate post -treatment \nperiod.693 \nPhysical Activity  \nActivity en hancement is a category 1 recommendation for the \nmanagement of fatigue in survivors. Improving strength, energy, and \nfitness through regular exercise, even a moderate -intensity walking \nprogram, has been shown to facilitate the transition from patient to \nsurvivor, decrease anxiety and depression, improve body image, and \nincrease tolerance for physical activity. Therefore, survivors with moderate \nto severe fatigue should be encouraged to maintain adequate levels of \nphysical activity (category 1). Robust data support the efficacy of \nincreased physical activity for reducing fatigue in patients with cancer and \nsurvivors.204,210,215,217,219,560,694 -700 Multiple meta -analyses of randomized \ncontrolled trials have found that cancer survivors who participate in \nexercise interventions, either during or after treatment for cancer, \nexperience significant improvements in fatigue com pared with patients \nrandomized to the control group.204,700 -703 A randomized phase 3 trial that \nincluded 410 cancer survivors showed that a 4-week yoga therapy \nprogra m led to impro vements in fatigue and sleep quality and reductions in \ndaytime dysfunction .704 \nSurvivors at a higher risk of injury should be referred to a physical \ntherapist or exercise specialist (also see Healthy Lifestyles , above ). \nPsychosocial and Other Interventions  \nPsychosocial int erventions, such as CBT, MBSR, psycho -educational \ntherapy, and supportive expressive therapy, including support groups, \ncounseling, and journal writing (all category 1 recommendations), have \nalso been shown to reduce fatigue in cancer survivors, although d ata are \nnot entirely consistent.567,705 -710 Several meta -analyses have evaluated the \nrole of psychosocial interventions in reducing fatigue.700,705,709,711 For", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edc24522-89de-4324-935e-c7ee7f93dcbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "edc24522-89de-4324-935e-c7ee7f93dcbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "182", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c8367300-33de-4197-9045-45cfad9c84a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "182", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "c35ce5abfdbe8e12b3af01740bccf75f25552569eaa41bac1057085b505776e3"}, "3": {"node_id": "91dbf150-094c-41f9-beb3-a890c1f0baf1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "182", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "13d2807f46ca4bdf83185cd332c05198c5442f0a28ef4a2573470005f06e5fde"}}, "hash": "5bcca64ffa429c649c514c610af9023df5f2d445cafdb8a0348166c80e9e7e81", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-42 example, Kangas et al709 reported a weighted pooled mean effect of \u22120.31 \nfor psychosocial interventions on fatigue in an anal ysis of 3620 patients \nwith cancer from 41 studies.

Therefore, survivors with or at risk \nfor lymphedema should be educated to inform their medical provider \nimmediately of signs of infection in the affected area.  Risk of infections can be reduced by safe pet care and gardening techniques  (See \nImmunizations and Prevention of Infections , above ). Survivors should also \nbe educated on how to maintain  skin integrity  with meticulous skin care  of \nthe affected area that includes avoidance of  cuts, burns , skin irritants and \nallergens, insect bites,  and pet scratches.772,773 The use of moisturizing \nsoaps and over -the-counter, fragrance -free emollients may also be \nhelpful.773 \nObservational studies have demonstrated that air travel, venipuncture, and \nblood pressure measurement (via arm cuff) are not associated with \nexacerbation or development of lymphedema, and precautionary \nmeasures are likely unnece ssary.747,749,758,759,774 -777 For instance, in one \nstudy of 632 patients  with breast cancer prospectively screened for \nlymphedema with 3041 arm volume measurements , no association was \nfound between the development of lymphedema and blood draws , \ninjections, or air travel.759 In the absence of high -level data, however, the \npanel recommends that medical procedures such as venipuncture and \nblood pr essure measurements be done on the non \u2013at-risk arm/limb if \npossible.778 If necessary, procedures may be done using the at -risk \narm/limb. More research is needed to determine the effect of these \nprocedures on the risk of lymphedema.  \nSurvivors should be informed that  lymphedema is not a contraindication \nfor physical activity and that no special precautions are required for \ncardiovascular/aerobic exercise or strength training of unaffected limbs.255-\n260 In addition, continued full use of the involved extremity and ran ge-of-\nmotion exercises should be encouraged to maintain strength and range of \nmotion even in the presence of lymphedema.

The \nrecommendations here are intended for cisgender survivors based on the \navailability of data in this population, but should be foll owed for \ntransgender and intersex survivors as applicable, with the involvement of \nthe appropriate health care specialists.  \nHormonal symptoms  in cancer survivors have been most extensively \nstudied in female survivors after treatment of breast cancer. Hot flashes \nare reported to occur in about 46% to 73% of breast cancer survivors.781-\n784 In one stu dy of breast cancer survivors diagnosed at age 40 years or younger , 46% of participants  reported hot flashes , 51% reported vaginal \ndryness,  and 39% reported dyspareunia.784 Similarly, about 50% to 80% of \npatients  on ADT experience hot flashes, which can persist after \ntreatment.785-790 The incidence of g ynecomastia in patients  on ADT varies \nwith the method of ADT used and can be as high as 80% in those  on \nestrogen therapy .787,791 \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship define menopause as no menses \nfor one year in the absence of prior chemotherapy or tamoxifen use or no \nmenses after surgical removal of all ovarian tissue. Healthy individuals  \nreach menopause at a mean age of 51 years, with 95% reaching \nmenopause between 45 and 55 years of age.792 Many cancer survivors \nexperience menopausal symptoms without meeting the definition of \nmenopause, including female survivors on tamoxifen or aromatase \ninhibitors  or with a history of oophorectomy or  chemotherapy  and male \nsurvivors who received o r are receiving androgen ablative therapies (ie, \nADT). These symptoms can include hot flashes/night sweats, vaginal \ndryness, urinary complaint s, sexual dysfunction, sleep disturbance, mood \ndisturbance, depression, cognitive dysfunction, arthralgias/myalgia s, and \nfatigue. Hormonal  symptoms can occur in  patients of all genders . \nIndividuals assigned male at b irth may experience  many of the same \nsymptoms as those assigned female at birth , as well as  gynecomastia, \ndecreased testicle size, and thinning of body hair.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d4d4658-4f1f-44a7-8ba9-fa554b9f442e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d4d4658-4f1f-44a7-8ba9-fa554b9f442e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "874880cd-6f84-421a-bc78-98e0f7e16163", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "da3128b3723b23463f31316b88d523f50bdcc3e1b71bea52331092de345c0c91"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe29494c-c36d-4d35-9907-7b652576bf3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "9fb935a775257026b367e191032a0fb3651874a845fc3a28b51678881a9ac138"}}, "hash": "3f1d9303590e6fa4dcb3582fd0f44e1a52270ef49b88c90511bd36bb9015c279", "text": "Hormonal symptoms \ncan have a profound impact on quality  of life.783,793  \nPremenopausal cancer survivors who have received chemotherapy may \nexperience transient or permanent menopause , dependent on the age of \nthe patient and the type of chemotherapy.794-796 If appropriate and desired, \nreferral for fertility preservation should be considered before \nchemotherapy, because s tudies report that 33% to 73% of premenopausal \npatients  treated for breast cancer become peri - or postmenopausal after \ntreatment.783 Younger survivors with irregular menses may have primary", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45d641cd-dbf0-4e45-8188-5997bfe1b8b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "45d641cd-dbf0-4e45-8188-5997bfe1b8b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d46f56f6-68ec-4b46-80dc-2ff9f6e75160", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "fb69f04a7fd1583b7c3f158538f24a830d1373ead8aca39c0d69472d503e254a"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a2c9be8-5192-434c-b96c-ace8c79db6ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "09504c8e1a72ca1e2eec292a1cc44fb33867ce89cf54a14c5726dcaf88d98edc"}}, "hash": "72722932272687147404a9edc952d4e1ae5b3cffedd0361482771f950730a2a2", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-47 ovarian insufficiency and  may develop menopausal symptoms.797 These \npatients  may or may not be fertile , and should be counseled about the \npossibility of pregnancy despite amenorrhea  if they are sexually active and \ndo not meet the def inition of menopause .

Doses of antidepressants required for improvements in \nvasomotor symptoms are typically much lower than those needed for \ndepression, and the response is typically faster. Side effects in clude dry \nmouth, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, constipation, and possible \nsexual dysfunction. Upon discontinuation, SNRIs and SSRIs should be \ngradually tapered to minimize withdrawal symptoms.  Venlafaxine has \nbeen the most  well studied, and the p anel lists venlafaxine as the \npreferred antidepressant for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms.  \nThe anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin have also been shown to \nimprove hormone -related vasomotor symptoms in the general population \nand in female cancer sur vivors.820-825 For example, one trial of 420 \nsurvivors of breast cancer experiencing \u22652 hot flashes/day found that 900 \nmg/day  gabapentin decreased the hot flash severity score by 46% at 8 \nweeks compared with a  15% reduction in the placebo group.824 The panel \nlists gabapentin as the preferred anticonvulsant for the treatment of \nvasomotor symptoms.

Side \neffects of anticonvulsants include somnolence, so they may be particularly \nuseful when given at bedtime in patients with hot flashes disturbin g sleep.  \nSmall studies provide evidence that the alpha agonist antihypertensive \nclonidine can reduce hot flashes in some healthy postmenopausal \nindividuals .826,827 Randomized controlled trials in breast cancer survivors \nalso show that clonidine can reduce hot flash  frequency and severity in \npostmenopausal  survivors taking tamoxifen.828,829 Side effects include \nsleep difficulties, dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea.  \nSeveral studies have compared non -hormonal pharmacologic treatments. \nFor example, venlafaxine has been compared with clonidine in breast \ncancer survivors.830-832 Results of these studies have varied, but it appears \nthat venlafaxine may have a faster effect but is less well tolerated than  clonidine.

The HABITS trial found an \nincreased risk of breast cancer recurrence with the use of MHT; the \ncumulative incidence at 5  years was 22.2% in the MHT arm and 8.0% in \nthe control arm.894 In the Stockholm trial, no difference was seen in breast \ncancer recurrence after 10.8 years of follow -up.895  \nOverall, based on these data, the panel believ es that MHT can be used in \nappropriate female cancer survivors. Alternatives to MHT should typically \nbe tried first and patients should be referred to an appropriate specialist for \ndosing and management of MHT.

Other hormonal options for \ntreating hot flashes include novel therapies that combine a selective \nestrogen  receptor modulator (SERM) with estrogen,  creating a tissue -\nselective estrogen complex (TSEC).

Significant improvements in symptoms were \nobserved in as many as 84% of participants , although sample sizes are \nsmall.915-917 Limited data also suggest that the laser treatment is effective \nin breast cancer survivors.918-921 Studies suggest th at adverse events are \ninfrequent and include pelvic pain, vaginal infections,  genital herpes  \nreactivation, and postmenopausal bleeding.915,918,920 However, the FDA \nissued a safety communication in July 2018 warning that energy -based \ndevices such as lasers u sed for vaginal procedures including the \ntreatment of menopausal symptoms may be associated with serious \nadverse events.922 The FDA has not cl eared or approved for marketing  \nany energy -based devic es for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and \nnotes that the safety and effectiveness of these devices for these types of \ntreatments have not been established. The panel believes that larger trials \nare needed before this technique can be recommended.  \nTreatment of Urogenital Complaints  \nPatients  sometimes present with urogenital complaints associated with \nmenopause, such as urogenital atrophy and urinary incontinence.

Barriers to optimal pain \nmanagement in cancer survivor s include health care providers\u2019 lack of \ntraining, fear of side effects and addiction, and reimbursement issues.947 \nPain has two predominant mechanisms: nociceptive and  neuropathic.948,949 \nInjury to somatic and visceral structures and the resulting activation of \nnociceptors present in skin, viscera, muscles, and connective tissues \ncause nociceptive pain. Somatic nociceptive pain is often d escribed as \nsharp, throbbing, or pressure -like, and often occurs after surgical \nprocedures.

Neuropathic pain is caused by injury to the peripheral \nnervous system or CNS  and might be described as numbness or as \nburning, sharp,  tingling, prickling, electrical,  or shooting  pain. Neuropathic \npain often occurs as a side  effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or \nis caused by  surgical injury to the nerves.

In another study of 66 \nsurvivors of breast cancer, those randomized to an 8 -week water exercise \nprogram experienced a greater reduction of neck and shoulder pain  than \nthose randomized to usual care.1015 A more recent randomized trial \nshowed that breast cancer survivors with aromatase -inhibitor \u2013induced \narthralgia randomized to an exercise arm ( 150 min /wk of aerobic exercise \nplus supervised stren gth training twice per week ) experienced greater \nimprovements in worst joint pain scores, pain severity, and pain \ninterference than those in the usual care arm (all P < .001).1018 Physical activity is thus listed as a category  1 recommendation for survivors with \naromatase inhibitor -induced arthralgia . \nIn addition, group exercise in the community with trainers specifically \ntrained to work with cancer survivors has been shown to redu ce pain and \nother symptoms.291 Yoga may also be helpful for pain management in \ncancer survivors. In a randomized controlled trial of 167 breast cancer \nsurvivors on aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen, yoga reduced \nmusculoskeletal pain symptoms .1020  \nLocal Therapies  \nLocal therapies , including heat , cold packs, massage, and medicated \ncreams, ointments, and patche s, are recommended for the treatment of \nmyalgias, arthralgias, and neuropathic pain.944 Specifically, t opical \nointments (ketamine) and patches ( ie, lidocaine, capsaicin)  are \nrecommended for myofascial pain. Compound ed creams containing \nagents such as lidocaine, capsaicin, baclofen, ketamine, and amitriptyline \nare recommended for treatment of neuropathic pain. Use of \ntranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)  can be used for \nneuropathic pain and for chronic post -mastectomy and post -thoracotomy \npain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx":

The FDA has not cleared energy -based devices ( ie, vaginal \nrejuvenation by lasers or erectile dy sfunction [ ED] by shock waves , also \ndiscussed in Treatment of Vaginal Dryness, above and Interventions for \nMale Sexual Dysfunction, below ) for treatment of menopausal changes, \nED, or incontinence.

In \nthe case of surgery, ED may be immediately evident; in the case of \nradiation treatments, presentations can be delayed. ED occurs frequently \nin the general population and increases with age.1071 In one community -\nbased study, 33% of participants  aged \u226575 years reported moderate or \nworse  ED.1072 ED is also very common in cancer survivors.  Anticancer \ntreatment modalities used in a variety of cancers have the potential to \ndamage blood vessels, leading to a reduction in blood circulation to the \npenis and/or damage to the autonomic nervous system. Thus, higher rates \nof ED are seen in cancer su rvivors than in the general population. The \nprevalence of ED in male survivors of colorectal cancer has been reported \nto range from 45% to 75%,1042,1073,1074 and it has been reported in up to \n90% of survivors of prostate cancer.1075 -1079   \nMale cancer survivors exposed to radiation or chemotherapy often \nexperience hypogonadism \u2014usually primary hypogonadism. \nHypogonadism refers to a decrease i n the production of sperm and/or \ntestosterone. Primary hypogonadism is the result of testicular failure ; \ntestosterone levels and sperm counts are below normal, and serum LH \nand FSH are above normal. Secondary hypogonadism is a disease of the \npituitary or hypothalamus. In survivors  with secondary hypogonadism, \nserum testosterone levels and sperm counts are subnormal, and the \nserum LH and FSH levels are normal or reduced. Adult -onset \nhypogonadism is characterized by a deficiency of testosterone and a \nfailure of the body to produce an adequate compensatory response. In \nthese individuals , low testosterone levels are associated with normal or \nlow levels of gonadotropins, suggesting physiologic failure of both the \ntesticles and hypothalamic -pituitary system.1080 Evaluation and Assessment for Sexual Function  \nAll adult cancer survivors, regardless of gender identity and sexual \norientation, should be ask ed about their sexual function at regular \nintervals, by inquiring about any concerns or distress regarding sexual \nfunction, sexual activity, sexual relationships, or sex life . Cancer survivors \nwho report distress should be evaluated further. Inquiries into  treatment -\nrelated infertility should be made if indicated, with referrals as appropriate. \nASCO\u2019s recently updated clinical practice guidelines on  fertility \npreservation for patients with cancer  have more information on the \ntopic.1081 It is important for providers to be aware that fertility issues should \nbe addressed in the survivorship phase, whether or not they were \naddressed prior to treatment.1082 -1084 A discussion regarding the need for \ncontraception may also be helpful in some cases, because the incidence \nof unplanned pregnancies is approximately three  times higher in cancer \nsurvivors than in the general population.1085 \nSurvivors for whom screening does not indicate an issue with sexual \nfunction shou ld be rescreened at subsequent visits.

Therefore, \ntreatment of sexual dysfunction often requires a multidimensional \ntreatment plan that addresses the underlying issues, which can be \nphysiologi c (eg, menopause, illness), disease -induced, medication -\ninduced, psychologic ( eg, anxiety , depression), and interpersonal.  \nInformed patient and physician decision -making is the standard for guiding \ntreatment decisions for treatment of female sexual dysfunction.  Referrals \nto specialists (ie, psychotherapy, sexual/couples counseling, gynecologic \ncare, sexual health specialist) should be made if appropriate and \navailable.   Overall, the evidence base for interventions to treat female sexual \ndysfunction in survivors is  weak and high -quality studies are \nneeded.1095,1096 Based on evidence from other populations, evidence from \nsurvivors when available, recommendations from the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),1053 and consensus among \nNCCN Survivorship Panel Members , the panel made recommendations \nfor treatment of female se xual dysfunction in survivors. The panel \nrecommends that treatment be guided by the specific type of problem.  \nTreatments depend on the type of sexual dysfunction and may include \nboth over -the-counter and prescription options, as well as pelvic physical \ntherapy and integrative therapies. When prescription medications are \nbeing considered, the risks and benefits should be discussed, or the \nsurvivor should be referred to an appropriate health care provider (eg, \nsexual health specialist) for prescription and/or  treatment. The evidence \nbase for each recommendation is described here in. \nIntegrative therapies, including yoga and meditation, may be helpful for \nfemale survivors with sexual dysfunction.857,1097 In addition, CBT has been \nshown to be effective at improving sexual functioning in breast cancer \nsurvivors.1098 \nVaginal moisturizers, vaginal gels, oils, and topical vitamin D or E can help \nalleviate symptoms such as vaginal dryness and sexual pain ,901,1099 \nalthough data on these over -the-counter products are limited in the \ngeneral population (also see Treatment of Vaginal Dryness , under \nHormone -Related Symptoms  above).

The panel lists  screening questions that can help determine \nwhether concerns about  sleep disorders or disturbances warrant further \nassessment. Other tools to screen  for sleep problems have  also been \nvalidated  and may be used for individual intensive screening to assess \nsleep quality .1186 -1189 It is important to note that survivors may have more \nthan 1 sleep disorder simultaneously . \nThe panel recommends that sleep/wake timing and/or sleep  logs or diaries \nbe reviewed. Many survivors may be using wearable devices to track \nsleep. However, studies have shown that the se devices  do not accurately \nmeasure sleep when compared to results of polysomnography .1190-1195 \nResults from wearable devices may be useful for tracking sleep patterns, \nbut should not be used  for diagnosis or clinical decision -making . \nIf concerns regarding sleep quality are significant, the panel recommends \nthat treatable  or modifiable  contributing factors be assessed and \nmanaged. Comorbidities that can contribute to sleep problems include \nalcohol and substance abuse, obesity, cardiac dysfunction, endocrine \ndysfunction, respiratory disorders, anemia, neurologic disorders  (including \nCIPN) , pain, fatigue, and emotional distress. Screening for common sleep \ndisorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), restless legs syndrome (RLS, also known as Willis -Ekbom disease), and circadian rhythm sleep \nwake disorders (such as shift wor k) can help identify specific therapies for \nthese conditions that may be helpful. In addition, some medications, both \nprescription and over -the-counter, can contribute to sleep issues. For \ninstance, pain medication, antiemetics, antihistamines , antidepress ants, \nand antipsychotics  can all contribute to sleep disturbance, as can the \npersistent use of sleep aids.  \nDiagnosis of Sleep Disorders  \nThe panel divided s leep disorders into two general categories: 1) \ninsomnia ; and 2) sleep disturbance and/or excessive sleepiness. Insomnia \nis diagnosed when patients have difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or \nwaking up too early  at least 3 times per week for at least 4 weeks . These \ncategories were based on the most common type s of symptoms that \npatients with sleep disturbances are likely to report.  \nDiagnosing  patients with excessive sleepiness can be challenging, \nbecause  it can be caused by a variety of factors . When excessive \nsleepiness is associated with observed apneas or sn oring, the STOP \nquestionnaire can be used  as a screening tool to determine the risk of \nOSA.1196 Other screening tools for OSA risk have also been \nvalidated.1197,1198 Sleep studies can confirm the diagnosis of OSA ; \nalternatively, referral can be made to a sleep specialist or PCP for further \nevaluation . Narcolepsy should be considered when excessive sleepiness \nis accompanied by cataplexy. Parasomnias (eg, s leep walking, sleep \nparalysis, periodic limb movement disorder) and circadian rhythm \ndisorders (eg, shift work sleep disorder, advanced or delayed sleep phase \ndisorders) should also be considered; survivors with these types of sleep \ndisturbances may also p resent with symptoms of insomnia.  \nExcessive sleepiness can also be associated with uncomfortable \nsensations or an urge to move the legs (and sometimes the arms or other \nbody parts) .

It should also \nbe determined whether or not the insomnia symptoms are causing \ndistress,  impacting daytime functioning, or affecting the survivor\u2019s quality \nof life.  \nManagement of Sleep Disorders  \nIn all cases, comorbidities that may be contributing to the sleep disorder \nshould be addressed. Survivors should also be advised that sleepiness \ncan increase the risk of accidents, including while operating a motor \nvehicle. In addition, several types of interventions are recommended, as \ndescribed below.1173,1201,1202 Referral to a sleep specialist can be \nconsidered in most cases , especially for OSA, RLS, parasomnias, \ncircadian rhythm disorders, narcolep sy, and chronic or refractory \ninsomnia . Referral to a PCP can also be considered, except in cases of \ncircadian rhythm disorder , prolonged wakefulness or awakenings , \nprolonged nocturnal sleep (ie, >9 hours for adults) , cataplexy, frequent \nshort naps, vivid dreams,  disrupted sleep, or sleep paralysis, in which \ncases a sleep specialist is recommended.  \nSleep Hygiene Education  \nEducating survivors about general sleep hygiene is recommended, \nespecially for the treatment of  circadian rhythm disorders,  insomni a, and \nexcessive sleepiness associated with insufficient sleep time .1203 -1205 Key \npoints are listed in the guidelines and include regular mornin g or afternoon physical activity ; daytime exposure to bright light; keeping the sleep \nenvironment dark, quiet, and comfortable; and avoid ing heavy meals, \nmoderate to strenuous physical activity, alcohol, and nicotine near \nbedtime.  However, sleep hygiene al one is insufficient for the effective \nmanagement of sleep disorders.  \nPhysical Activity  \nPhysical activity  can improve sleep in middle -aged and older individuals in \nnon-cancer settings.1206 -1208 Physical activity may also improve sleep in \npatients with cancer and survivors.210,1209 -1214 One randomized controlled \ntrial compared a standardized yoga intervention plus standard care with \nstandard care alone in 410 survivors (75% breast cancer; 96% women) \nwith moderate to severe sl eep disruption.1211 Participants in the yoga arm \nexperienced greater improvements in global and subjective sleep quality, \ndaytime function ing, and sleep efficiency (all P \u2264 .05). In addition, the use \nof sleep medication declined in the intervention arm ( P \u2264 .05). However, a \n2013 systematic review concluded that the  evidence that yoga programs \naimed at cancer survivors  improve  insomnia or sleep quality  is very \nlimited.1215 Another randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of a 3-\nmonth physical activity beha vior change intervention on 222 breast cancer \nsurvivors.1216 Participants in the intervention arm experienced significant \nimprovement in self -reported global sleep quality at 3 and 6 months. \nHowever, actigraphy  results showed no differences between the \nintervention and usual care arms.

A recent meta -analysis \nidentified 8 studies, including 752 cancer survivors, and found large effect \nsizes for self-reported insomnia severity (d = .7 7) following CBT .1223 \nFurther, a meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials in cancer survivors \nfound strong evidence that CBT-I can produce large and durable effects \non insomnia severity.1223 In fact, the American College of Physicians  \nrecommends that CBT be  the initial treatment for all adults with chronic \ninsomnia dis order .1217 \nA small randomized controlled trial of 57 survivors  (54% breast cancer; \n75% women)  found that mind \u2013body interventions  (mindfulness meditation  \nor mind -body bridging)  decreased sleep d isturbance more than  sleep \nhygiene education  did.1224 A preliminary report of a subset of participants \nin a larger randomized controlled trial of breast cancer survivors showed \nthat MBSR improved objective sleep parameters, including sleep \nefficiency and percent of sleep time.1225 \nA randomized, partially  blinded, noninferiority trial  compared CBT with \nMBSR in 111 patients with cancer.1226 Both groups experi enced \nimprovements in s leep diary -measured sleep onset latency, wake after \nsleep onset , total sleep time, stress, and mood disturbance. MBSR was  inferior to CBT for improving insomnia severity immediately following  the \nintervention, but was noninferior at 5 months. These results have not been \nreplicated in survivors, and the relative efficacy of these strategies is not \nestablished in this population.  Another randomized study compared Tai \nChi Chih, a  mindful  movement meditation , with CBT -I in 90 breast cancer \nsurvivors and found it to be non -inferior for improving insomnia symptoms \nat 3, 6, and 15 months after the intervention.1227  \nPharmacologic Interventions  \nMany pharmacologic treatments for sleep disturbances are available, \nincluding hypnotics for insomnia (eg, zolpidem, ramelteon).1228,1229 Many of \nthe FDA -approved hypnotics are BZD receptor agonists and can be \nassociated with dependence, abuse, and withdrawal.

If detected \nearly, treatment for a late effect may reduce its \nimpact on your life.\nCancer surveillance\nCancer that was thought to be cured can \nreappear on tests. The return of cancer is \ncalled a recurrence or relapse. Survivorship \ncare includes routine checking for a recurrence. \nThis is called surveillance. Surveillance often \nincludes updating your health history and a \nphysical exam. Some survivors get blood tests \nor imaging like x-rays or scans.\nScreening for cancer\nCancer screening is routine testing of cancer \nor pre-cancer conditions. The aim is to detect \ncancer at an early stage when treatment works \nbest. There is screening for prostate, breast, \ncervical, skin, lung, and colorectal cancers. \nScreening is started when there is an average \nor high risk of cancer.

Such treatments include \nradiation therapy, certain chemotherapies, \nand certain targeted therapies. \u0086Excess radiation from a lifetime of \ncomputed tomography (CT) scans slightly \nincreases cancer risk. Ask your provider if \nthese scans are needed and for how long.\nSome survivors are at risk of hereditary \ncancers.

Your provider may suggest \ngetting genetic testing. A blood sample is \nneeded. You may talk with a genetic counselor \nto discuss your family\u2019s cancer history.\nLate effects\nMany effects of treatment quickly resolve \nafter treatment ends. An example is nausea \nand vomiting. Long-term effects start during \ntreatment and persist after treatment is done. \nLess often, effects start long after treatment \nhas ended. During health visits, your health \ncare providers will assess for such late effects. \nThey will provide treatment for late or long-term \neffects as needed.\nCoordinated care\nCancer survivors often receive care from \nmultiple providers. You may receive care from \noncologists, a primary care provider, and non-\ncancer specialists. Your providers will work \ntogether and clarify their roles to address all \nyour needs.

Hot flashes are \none of many symptoms that may occur \nas a result. Read this chapter to learn \nabout hormone-related symptoms and \ntreatment for hot flashes.\nSex hormones\nSex hormones play a key role in puberty, \nhaving babies, and overall health. Testosterone \nis the main male sex hormone and is made \nby the testicles (or testes). Estrogen and \nprogesterone are the main female sex \nhormones. The ovaries produce the most \nestrogen and progesterone.\nThe level of sex hormones declines as people \nage. The pattern of decline differs between the \nsexes. Testosterone made by the testes slowly \ndrops over many years. During a menstrual \ncycle, estrogen and progesterone levels rise \nand fall. They quickly drop when a person stops \nhaving menstrual cycles.\nThe end of menstrual cycles is called \nmenopause. Menopause caused by aging is \ncalled natural menopause. Health providers \nidentify natural menopause by an absence \nof menstrual periods for 12 months. There \nis a transition time to menopause called \nperimenopause. During perimenopause, \nmenstrual periods may start sooner or later \nthan normal.Causes of low sex hormones among cancer \nsurvivors include aging and cancer treatment. \nCertain cancer treatments reduce hormone \nlevels or block hormone effects. \n \u0086Hormone therapy for prostate cancer \ntargets male sex hormones. The most \ncommon form is called androgen \ndeprivation therapy (ADT).\n \u0086Orchiectomy is a surgery that removes \none or both testicles. It is a type of ADT \nand also treats testicular cancer.\n \u0086Chemotherapy, pelvic radiation, and \nsurgery may damage testes and ovaries. \nWhen damaged, these organs may not \nmake hormones.\n \u0086Endocrine therapy for breast cancer \ntargets female sex hormones.

You may \nbe able to take breaks from ADT to relieve side \neffects like hot flashes. This treatment approach \nis called intermittent ADT.\nHormones may be used to treat hot flashes \nbut are not safe for some cancer survivors. \nEstrogen by itself may be used to treat \nsurvivors whose uterus has been removed. It is \ngiven with progestin when the uterus is intact. \nMedroxyprogesterone, estrogen, and \ncyproterone acetate relieve hot flashes caused \nby ADT. Androgens are used to treat hot flashes \ncaused by treatment-damaged testicles but \nshould not be taken by prostate and breast \ncancer survivors.\nThere are medications without hormones that \nreduce hot flashes. Antidepressants treat hot \nflashes at lower doses and faster than they \ntreat depression. Anticonvulsants also treat hot \nflashes at lower doses than they treat seizures. \nAnticonvulsants can cause sleepiness, so they \nmay be most helpful for night sweats.

This chapter explains how \nlymphedema can be reversed in early \nstages. It also explains how to reduce \nsymptoms of lymphedema.  \nStages of lymphedema\nThe lymph (or lymphatic) system is a network of \nfluid and tissues in your body. It transports fluid \ncalled lymph to the bloodstream. It also helps \nfight infections and disease. \nThe space between cells in body tissue is filled \nwith fluid. When tissue fluid increases, some of \nit drains into ducts called lymph vessels. Lymph vessels transport the fluid, now called lymph, \nto the bloodstream. As lymph travels, it passes \nthough lymph tissue that filters out germs and \ncell waste. Lymph tissue includes the tonsils, \nspleen, and lymph nodes.\nLymphedema is a buildup of lymph in fatty \ntissue under the skin. It occurs when the lymph \nsystem is damaged or blocked. Lymph buildup \ncauses inflammation that can lead to scar \ntissue, infection, and fat deposits. \nSwelling is the key symptom of lymphedema. \nLymph may amass in a limb, neck, trunk, \ngenitals, or other part of the body. Swelling \noccurs on the side of the body that was treated.\nSymptoms of lymphedema by stage are listed \nin Guide 7 .\nGuide 7\nSymptoms of lymphedema by stage\nStage 0No swelling but there may be subtle symptoms, such as\n\u2022 A heavy feeling in a limb\n\u2022 Feeling of fatigue in a limb\nStage 1\u2022 Swelling can be seen on the side of body that was treated\n\u2022 Swelling in a limb is reduced with elevation or compression\n\u2022 An indent in the skin may occur when pressure is applied (called pitting)\n\u2022 Area with lymphedema is larger, heavier, or stiffer\nStage 2\u2022 The swollen area has a spongy texture\n\u2022 Swelling in limb does not decrease with elevation\n\u2022 An indent in the skin (pitting) is less visible as swelling increases\n\u2022 Scar tissue may form making the swollen area larger and feel hard \nStage 3\u2022 Swelling has further increased making the area larger\n\u2022 Skin of swollen area is severely dry, scaly, or thickened\n\u2022 In the limbs, fluid leakage and blisters are common\n\u2022 Moving limbs or turning your neck may be limited", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "865ad27f-1798-452b-a1a4-636f3f1542ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "865ad27f-1798-452b-a1a4-636f3f1542ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "98f7573b-ee10-474e-92ba-670957216635", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "8b027d61d32811d26f4e1a38cb439d88841523c159f09fa093e2656e76aee6e1"}}, "hash": "bbacc4581eab23ec2dc718b9767718f421851d089a9973d00463bf16ef8948fc", "text": "Lymphedema  Assessment and referral\nLymphedema may get worse over time without \ntreatment. Stage 0 lymphedema is the earliest \nstage when there are subtle or no symptoms. \nSwelling starts in stage 1 and gets worse in \nstages 2 and 3. \nLymphedema is common among cancer \nsurvivors. It may occur after surgery or radiation \nto lymph nodes near the armpit, collarbone, \nor groin. It may also occur after procedures \ncalled sentinel node biopsy and lymph node \ndissection. Assessment and referral\nIf you are at risk for lymphedema, your cancer \ndoctor will ask about symptoms at health \nvisits. Lymphedema can occur any time after \ncancer treatment but most often occurs within \n18 months. If symptoms are present, your \ndoctor will ask questions about:\n \u0086How often and severe is the swelling\n \u0086Pain or discomfort\n \u0086Loss of strength, range of motion, or \nmobility\n \u0086Ability to do things you usually do\nTo confirm that you have lymphedema, tests \nare needed to rule out a return or worsening of \ncancer. You then may be referred to a certified \nlymphedema therapist. This therapist may be a \nphysician, an occupational therapist, or physical \ntherapist.\nThe therapist may measure your limb. If not \nmeasured before treatment, the swollen limb \ncan be compared to the normal limb. You may \nneed to do stretches to check your range of \nmotion.\nLymphedema may cause or worsen distress, \ndepression, or anxiety. Tell your provider if you \nfeel distressed. There is help.

These skills include learning, \nreasoning, memory, problem solving, and \ndecision-making. Cognitive dysfunction is an \nimpairment of one or more thinking skills.\nMany cancer survivors report having some \ndegree of cognitive dysfunction. Common \nproblems occur with memory, attention, \nplanning, processing, and learning. Cognitive \ndysfunction may be caused by cancer and its \ntreatment. It may be more severe when cancer \nstarts in or spreads to the brain. \nCognitive dysfunction most commonly \noccurs after chemotherapy. When related to \nchemotherapy, it is often called \u201cchemobrain.\u201d \nThe causes of chemobrain are not well \nunderstood. Other cancer treatments that may \ncause cognitive dysfunction include endocrine \ntherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. \nCognitive dysfunction differs between cancer \nsurvivors. The type of problem varies. Problems \ncan be long-term or short lived. Most survivors \ndo not have severe problems but some do. \nWhen severe, cognitive dysfunction can impact \nquality of life and ability to work.Assessment\nAt this time, there isn\u2019t one good screening tool \nof cancer-related cognitive dysfunction. To get \nhelp, tell your health care provider about any \ncognitive problems you have. Ask family or \nfriends to share what they have observed. Your \nhealth care provider will ask questions about \nthe nature, onset, and course of the problem.\nYour provider will assess what is causing or \nadding to the cognitive dysfunction.

Counseling \nfocuses on management and coping strategies \nof cognitive dysfunction.Self-management strategies\nYou may improve your cognitive ability through \nbrain training. Brain training may include \ncognitive rehabilitation or cognitive behavioral \ntherapy. Both are described later in this section.\nIf you\u2019re forgetful, get organized and use \nmemory devices. Also, keep items in the same \nplace. Use notes, planners, and apps on smart \nphones. \nManage stress and energy. Practice relaxation \nusing meditation or by other means.

Your provider will order blood \ntests if you may have low red blood cell counts \n(anemia) or hormone levels (hypothyroidism). \nYou may see a sleep expert for further \nevaluation.\nIt is common to complete a sleep diary or wear \na tracking device. These tools are helpful for \nassessing sleep patterns. In the diary, you will \nrecord your bedtime, time you fell asleep, and \nthe time you got up for the day. Your diary will \nalso need to include if you woke up during the \nnight and for how long. Diaries also capture daytime naps. Your provider will ask about any \nstrategies you use to fall or stay asleep.\nA sleep study is sometimes needed to measure \nsleep. It is also called polysomnography. It \ndetects sleep-wake disorders like sleep apnea, \nnarcolepsy, and restless legs syndrome. A full \nsleep study is often done at a sleep center. \nSome studies for sleep apnea can be done at \nhome with a portable device. \nTreatment that works\nTreatment of sleep-wake disorders often has \nvery good results. Your cancer doctor will treat \nhealth conditions that are related to sleep-\nwake disorders. Such conditions include pain, \nobesity, anemia, heart disease, and hormone \nproblems. Your medications will be adjusted if \nthey affect your sleep. Specific treatments for \nsleep problems are listed in Guide 16 .\nPolysomnography\nA polysomnography is a sleep \nstudy. Sensors will be placed \non your body to detect brain \nwaves, heart rate, blood oxygen, \nbreathing, and movement. While \nyou sleep, a technician will \nmonitor and record your data.

Muscle \nrelaxers are an option for arthralgias, myalgias, \nand some types of bone pain. \nAntiresorptive medications\nYour bones are living organs. New \nbone replaces the old bone all the time. \nBone resorption is the breakdown and removal \nof old bone. Antiresorptive medications \nslow down bone resorption and help keep \nbones strong.

Pain patches stick \nto the skin like a band aid. Pain creams and \nointments are rubbed on the skin. Medications \nfrom patches, creams, or ointments pass \nthrough the skin and into the body. \nNon-pharmaceutical pain \nmanagement\nThere are many options for non-pharmaceutical \npain management. These options may be used \nwith or instead of medications. A list of non-\npharmaceutical pain management for cancer-\nrelated pain is in Guide 19 .\nPsychological and psychosocial \ntreatment\nPsychological and psychosocial treatments \nenhance a sense of control over pain. Cognitive \nbehavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing \nnegative thoughts and learning how to relax. \nOther treatments include skills training and \nsupportive-expressive therapy. Hypnosis may \nhelp to relieve neuropathic pain.\nPhysical therapy and activity\nIt is often helpful to be physically active even \nwhen in pain. Physical activity can increase \nmobility and strengthen muscles.

Read this chapter to learn \nhow to take care of your mental health.\nDistress is normal\nDistress is an unpleasant experience of a \nmental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. \nIt can affect the way you think, feel, or act. \nDistress is normal during cancer care, but it \nmay make it harder to cope with cancer. \nDistress ranges from mild to severe levels. \nMany survivors have a normal fear of a cancer \nrecurrence. Mild distress may reduce quality of \nlife. Severe distress can affect a person\u2019s self-\ncare, social life, mood, or faith. Survivors with \nsevere distress may not go to health visits or \nhave a healthy lifestyle.\nDistress can lead to or worsen mental \ndisorders. Mental disorders are health \nconditions just like heart disease is a health \ncondition. There are many types of mental \ndisorders. Each mental disorder is a group of \nsymptoms that are related to major problems \nwith emotion, thinking, or behavior. Anxiety \nand depressive disorders are common among \ncancer survivors.\n \u0086Symptoms of anxiety include severe \nfear or worry, panic attacks, and strong \nbehavioral impulses.\n \u0086Symptoms of depression include feeling \ndown or irritable and losing interest in \nthings that you used to like.Screening and assessment\nYour cancer or primary care provider may \nscreen for distress or mental disorders on a \nregular basis. Ongoing screening is important. \nMental health issues can start any time after a \ncancer diagnosis. Also, your provider may not \nknow you\u2019re struggling unless you very clearly \nsay so.\nDistress can occur at any point in time, but \nthere are times when distress is more likely. \nDistress is likely during routine health care \nvisits, when getting health tests, or when \nsymptoms occur. Mental health screening is \nvery important at these times.\nA mental health screening tool consists of a \nbrief scale or short survey. If you\u2019re struggling \nwith a mental health issue, your provider \nwill ask more questions. It\u2019s important to \nunderstand the type and cause of distress and \nto rule out other health conditions.

It may \nbe too imprecise for people who are muscular. \nMeasuring the size of the waistline may be \nbetter. Cisgender research supports that a \nwaist bigger than 35 inches for women and 40 \ninches for men increases risk for disease.\nMetabolic health \nMetabolism is the chemical processes in \nthe body that are needed to live. A healthy \nBMI formula\nBMI is based on weight and height. \nIn the metric formula, weight is \nmeasured in kilograms and height \nin meters. It can also be calculated \nby weight in pounds and height in \ninches if multiplied by 703.

Such allergies may impact which vaccines \nyou can receive.\nBefore vaccination, your immune system \nshould be as strong as possible. Vaccines may \nnot work well if your immune system is weak. \nThe number of immune cells (white blood cells) \nin your body should be normal or stable. You \nmust not have any ongoing infection. \n5 steps to wash hands\n1. Wet your hands with clean, running \nwater then apply soap.\n2. Rub and lather your entire hands \nincluding back of hand, between \nfingers, and under nails.\n3. Scrub for at least 20 seconds.\n4. Rinse your hands well under clean, \nrunning water.\n5.

If they do, keep your distance for \n2 to 6 weeks depending on the vaccine. Avoid \ncontact with feces and urine of children for \n4 weeks after they get a rotavirus vaccine.\nNon-live vaccines are safe for cancer survivors. \nInactivated vaccines contain a germ that has \nbeen killed. Subunit vaccines contain a part \nof a germ. Subtypes include recombinant, \npolysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines. Toxoid \nvaccines contain a disease-causing protein \nfrom the germ. They cause a strong immune \nresponse if you are exposed to the real germ.\nTiming of vaccinations\nThe immune system is weak during some \ncancer treatments. It may remain weak for a \ntime after treatment ends. Vaccines are less \nsafe when your immune system is weakened. \nIf you need a vaccine, get it when your immune \nsystem is as close to normal as possible.\nGet non-live vaccines:\n \u0086At least 2 weeks before cancer treatment\nor\n \u0086At least 3 months after chemotherapy or \nradiation therapy when possible\n \u0086At least 6 months after a blood stem cell \ntransplant\n \u0086At least 6 months after chemotherapy \nand the last dose of anti\u2013B-cell antibody \ntherapy\nIf needed, you may be able to receive some \nvaccines during cancer treatment.
