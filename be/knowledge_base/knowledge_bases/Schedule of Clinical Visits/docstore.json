This assessment can be done by the oncologist or \nPCP. Shared , coordinated care between the oncology , primary care , and \nsubspecialty care  provider s is encouraged.  Depending on the cancer type \nand stage of disease, transition of care to primary care may be done when \ndeemed clinically appropriate, with referral back to oncologic care as \nneeded. The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be \naddressed at every visit.  \nSome tools that screen for long -term and late physical and psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment in survivors  have been validated.171-176 \nIn addition, the NCCN Survivorship Panel  created a sample screening \ninstrument  that is guideline -specific and can be self-administered or \nadministered by an interviewer . This assessment tool was developed \nspecifically for use in co mbination with the NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship to help providers deliver necessary and comprehensive \nsurvivorship care. Although this instrument has not yet been piloted or \nvalidated, t he answers can be used to guide  providers to  topics within the \nguidelines that require  more in -depth assessment  via validated tools \nand/or clinical evaluation.  \nIn addition  to screening by history and physical examination , care \nproviders should assess the following  at regular intervals:  \n1. Current disease status  \n2. Functional/p erformance status  \n3. Medication use ( including over -the-counter medications and \nsupplements ) \n4. Comorbidities  \n5. Prior cancer treatment history and modalities used  \n6. Family history  7. Psychosocial factors  \n8. Weight and health behaviors that can modify cancer and \ncomorbidity risk (including cigarette/tobacco, alcohol use)  \n9.

For examp le, patients w ho received pelvic irradiation or \nsurgery are at risk for sexual dysfunction; patients with a history of brain \nmetastasis or cranial irradiation have an elevated  risk for cognitive \ndysfunction. In general, those who underwent more intensive t herapy are \nat higher risk for multiple late and/or long -term effects. Survivors \nundergoing certain treatments, such as mantle field radiation or certain \nsystemic therapies, may be at increased risk for subsequent malignancies. \nThose survivors who continue to smoke are at increased risk for smoking -\nrelated comorbidities and subsequent primary cancers.  \nReassessment  \nSurvivors should be followed and reassessed at regular intervals, \ndepending on the nature and severity of late and long -term effects being \ntreated . At each time point, assessment of disease status and ongoing \neffects of cancer and its treatment should be addressed. In addition, \nsurvivors should be periodically rescreened for the development of new \nlate and long -term effects of cancer and its treatme nt. The outcomes of \nany interventions for ongoing effects of cancer and its treatment should be \nevaluated regularly based on best practices and available resources. \nOutcome assessment may include survivor satisfaction with the \neffectiveness of the interven tion in reducing symptom burden, adequate \npain control, receipt of recommended immunizations and preventive care,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d69a5464-620b-4182-9efd-02c6465bc6cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "d69a5464-620b-4182-9efd-02c6465bc6cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7dc73834-adad-4027-a2a4-b744fb5ebc5e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "82696164c74a4394161bbc03efc5ba71a20677143c6e7d6c2ddd829d8ef07321"}}, "hash": "82696164c74a4394161bbc03efc5ba71a20677143c6e7d6c2ddd829d8ef07321", "text": "STANDARDS FOR SURVIVORSHIP CAREb\nCare of the cancer survivor should include:\n1.

In addition, a pilot study asses sed the use of electronic \nhealth records (EHRs) to reduce the time and effort involved with creating \ncare plans.165 Although many plan elements required manual entry by the \noncologist, the median time to complete the plans was only 3 minutes \n(range 2 \u201312 minutes ). Another group reported on a similar initiative to \nfacilitate genera tion of care plans using EHRs.166 Care plan creation took a \nmean 12 minutes (range 10 \u201315 minutes). However, a study in which EHR -\nbased treatment summaries were abstracted and cross -checked revealed \nthat 30% contained \u22651 omissions , and 10% contained \u22651 errors, indicating \nthat autopopulatio n systems will require manual double -checking to \nensure accuracy.167 Thus, providing a survivorship care plan is time -\nconsuming and resource -intensive and could have unforeseen \nharms.154,168 \nBecause definitive evidence that survivorship care plans improve \noutcomes is lacking, the NCCN Survivo rship Panel currently recommends \nplanning for ongoing survivorship care, but does not mandate the use of \nsurvivorship care  plans .

In general, this surveillance is performed by the oncology team. \nWhen surveillance is overseen by the primary care team, the oncologist \nshould provide evidence -based recommendations based on currently \navailable guidelines. Specific recommendations for surveillance testing \nvary between cancer site and stage and individualized patient risk and are \nnot addressed in these guidelines. Please see individual NCCN Guide lines \nfor Treatment of Cancer by Site (available online at www.NCCN.org ) for \ndisease -specific surveillance recommendations. Additional lab work, \nimaging studies, or other studies to eval uate for recurrence should be \nbased on clinical presentation and judgment. The use of radiologic \nimaging studies (ie, CT) should be based on evidence that early detection \nof recurrence will improve cancer -related outcomes, because evidence \nsuggests that ex cess radiation exposure associated with CT imaging may \nbe associated with an increased risk of developing a radiation -associated \ncancer.169,170", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de019101-3041-4ca4-a547-43eb439a8f9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "de019101-3041-4ca4-a547-43eb439a8f9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75d81712-9eb7-4bec-acf9-62edc2445040", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "f7d50372bc9be31b09b39a850090d7d1934ef5e71b31aafdbc4f1db5d247215d"}}, "hash": "f7d50372bc9be31b09b39a850090d7d1934ef5e71b31aafdbc4f1db5d247215d", "text": "Survivorship  Survivorship guidelines\nOngoing planning of care\nA key part of survivorship care is ongoing \nplanning of your health care.

Although achieving all of these healthy lifestyle goals may be \ndifficult for many survivors, eve n small reductions in weight among \noverweight or obese survivors or small increases in physical activity \namong sedentary individuals are thought to yield meaningful \nimprovements in cancer -specific outcomes and overall health.202 Clinicians \nshould assess individual and  community -level barriers to meeting the \nhealthy lifestyle recommendations and support patients in developing \nstrategies to overcome challenges.  \nPhysical Activity  \nDuring cancer treatment, many survivors become deconditioned and can \ndevelop impaired cardiov ascular fitness because of the direct and \nsecondary effects of therapy.203 Randomized trials have shown that \nexercise training is safe, tolerable, and effective for most survivors. \nStructured aerobic and resistance training programs after treatment can \nimprove  cardiovascular fitness and strength and can have positive effects \non balance, body composition, fatigue, emotional well -being, and quality of \nlife.204-216 The effectiveness of exercise is especially well studied in \npatients  with early -stage breast cancer. Survivors of breast cancer who \nexercise have  improved cardiovascular fitness and therefore an increased \ncapacity to perform daily life functions, resulting in a better quality of \nlife.214,215,217 -219 Furthermore, a study of adult survivors of childhood \nHodgkin lymphoma  found that vigorous exercise was associated with a \nreduction in the risk of  major  cardiovascular  event s after a median follow -\nup of 11.9 years.220 In fact, the finding was dose -dependent, and survivors \nwho reported \u22659 metabolic equivalent (MET ) h/wk experienced a 51% \nreduction in risk compared with those reporting <9 MET h/wk (P = .002).  A similar study in patients with breast cancer found a similar reduction in the \nrisk of cardiovascular events  with \u22659 MET h/wk .221 \nIn addition, observational studies have consistentl y found that p hysical  \nactivity is linked to decreased cancer incidence and recurrence and \nincreased survival for certain tumor types.209,222 -239 For example, one meta -\nanalysis of 6 studies including more than 12,000 survivors of breast \ncancer found that post -diagnosis physical activity reduced all -cause \nmortality by 41% ( P < .00001)  and disease recurrence by 24% ( P = \n.00001).226 Data from other meta -analyses primarily consisting of \nobservational studies of survivors of colorectal, ovarian, non -small cell \nlung, brain, prostate, and breast cancers show that physical activity is \nassociated with decreased all -cause mortality and/or cancer -specific \nmortality.224,227,236,240 In fact, analyses of data from 986 survivors of breast \ncancer  from the National Ru nners' and Walkers' Health Studies  found that \nmortality decreased with increased rates of energy expenditure.237 \nEvidence in other disease sites is less robust, but also suggests survival \nbenefits associated with exercise in survivors after treatment.240 \nData also support the idea that inactivity/sedentary behavior is  a risk factor \nfor cancer incidence  and mortality and impacts mood and quality of life in \nsurvivors,  independent of the level of an individual\u2019s recreational or \noccupational physical activity.192,241 -247 For example, i n a cohort of more \nthan 2000 survivors of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, those who spent \nmore leisure time sitting had a higher  mortality than those who spent more \ntime in recreational activity.192 \nEvaluation

It raises the risk for new cancers \nand death among cancer survivors. It is linked \nto depressed mood and lower quality of life. \nGeneral goals are to move more and not to be \ninactive for long periods of time.Increase your heart rate\nAny physical activity is better than none. To \nfurther improve your fitness, do activities that \nincrease your heart rate. Among the 3 groups \nof physical activity, moderate and vigorous \nactivities get the heart pumping.\n \u0086Light activity is movement that doesn\u2019t \ncause any change in breathing\n \u0086Moderate activity is movement during \nwhich you can talk but can\u2019t sing\n \u0086Vigorous activity is movement that makes \nit hard to breath when talking\nA general goal is to do physical activity at \na moderate or vigorous intensity during \nthe week. At least 150 to 300 minutes of \nmoderate-intensity activity is recommended. \nThat\u2019s at least 2\u00bd to 5 hours a week. If you \nchoose vigorous-intensity activity, 75 minutes \nis recommended.

For additional information about fatigue in survivors and \npatients with cancer, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer -Related \nFatigue (available at www.NCCN.org ). These guidelines may be modified \nto fit the individual survivor\u2019s circumstance s. \nTreatment of Contributing Factors  \nManagement of fatigue in survivors first includes the treatment of \ncontributing factors such as pain, distress, anemia, and sleep disturbances \n(more information on  the treatment of pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep \ndisorders in survivors can be found throughout these guidelines). In a \nrandomized controlled trial of 152 fatigued patients with advanced cancer, \ntreatment of accompanying physical symptoms, including pain, nausea, \nvomiting, and shortness of breath, resulted  in a significantly higher impact \non general fatigue, activity, and motivation than usual care.692 \nPatient and Family Education and Counseling  \nEducation and counseling can be beneficial in helping patients cope with \nfatigue. Understanding typical patterns of fatigue during and after \ntreatment can help patients set reasonable expectations regarding \nimprovements in energy after the completion of can cer therapy and can \nhelp allay concerns that persistent fatigue after the completion of therapy \nis evidence of disease recurrence. Counseling can help patients develop \nstrategies for self -monitoring of fatigue and techniques such as energy conservation tha t may be helpful in the immediate post -treatment \nperiod.693 \nPhysical Activity  \nActivity en hancement is a category 1 recommendation for the \nmanagement of fatigue in survivors. Improving strength, energy, and \nfitness through regular exercise, even a moderate -intensity walking \nprogram, has been shown to facilitate the transition from patient to \nsurvivor, decrease anxiety and depression, improve body image, and \nincrease tolerance for physical activity. Therefore, survivors with moderate \nto severe fatigue should be encouraged to maintain adequate levels of \nphysical activity (category 1). Robust data support the efficacy of \nincreased physical activity for reducing fatigue in patients with cancer and \nsurvivors.204,210,215,217,219,560,694 -700 Multiple meta -analyses of randomized \ncontrolled trials have found that cancer survivors who participate in \nexercise interventions, either during or after treatment for cancer, \nexperience significant improvements in fatigue com pared with patients \nrandomized to the control group.204,700 -703 A randomized phase 3 trial that \nincluded 410 cancer survivors showed that a 4-week yoga therapy \nprogra m led to impro vements in fatigue and sleep quality and reductions in \ndaytime dysfunction .704 \nSurvivors at a higher risk of injury should be referred to a physical \ntherapist or exercise specialist (also see Healthy Lifestyles , above ). \nPsychosocial and Other Interventions  \nPsychosocial int erventions, such as CBT, MBSR, psycho -educational \ntherapy, and supportive expressive therapy, including support groups, \ncounseling, and journal writing (all category 1 recommendations), have \nalso been shown to reduce fatigue in cancer survivors, although d ata are \nnot entirely consistent.567,705 -710 Several meta -analyses have evaluated the \nrole of psychosocial interventions in reducing fatigue.700,705,709,711 For", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bd6fde8-a0b2-436a-8b81-9ce55b907fb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bd6fde8-a0b2-436a-8b81-9ce55b907fb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86804d78-bb27-47fb-a5f7-971d8f14c57f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "ae43579617ee94cf3767b015f2162a0880152c9a55b91d1aabc7d472183b1ace"}}, "hash": "ae43579617ee94cf3767b015f2162a0880152c9a55b91d1aabc7d472183b1ace", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-12 and improved adherence to guideline recommendations for health \nbehaviors.  \nSurvivorship Research  \nThe IOM survivorship report  cites a paucity of  longitudinal cohort studies \nlinking specific cancer types or treatments with specific late effect s, \nmaking it difficult to predict risk for individual patients.28 Research is \nneeded to increase understanding of the prevalence of, mechanisms of, \nand risks factors for late and long -term effects of cancer and its treatme nt. \nIn addition, research is needed to better define interventions that relieve \nsymptoms, restore function, and improve the quality of life of survivors.177 \nFinally, research can help better define optimal follow -up and surveillance \nschedules for cancer survivors after treatment.178,179 \nAn ASCO survey report highlighted several key gaps in current \nsurvivorship research.180 For instance, more research pertaining to \nsurvivors >65 years of age, to survivors of cancers other than breast, and \nto long -term survivors (>5 years) is needed. In addition, research focused \non patterns and quality of survivorship care  is lacking. A study of NIH \nsurvivorship grants in fiscal year 2016 showed a need for research \nincluding more diverse cancer types, older and longer -term survivors, and \nmore ethnoculturally diverse populations of survivors.181 \nIn June 2012, the ACS , CDC, LIVE STRONG  Foundation , and NCI held a \njoint meeting and created an action plan to facilitate the translation of \nsurvivorship research into survivorship care.182 The plan is driven by \ncollaboration between researchers, survivors, clinicians, and public health \nprofessionals; the use of technology, such as EHRs; analysis of \ninformation from the vie wpoints of multiple stakeholders; and the \nintegration and synthesis of knowledge using systematic reviews and \nmeta -analyses.  Recommendations for Preventive Health  \nAnalysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  \n(BRFSS)  indicates that a  large proportion of cancer survivors have \nsignificant comorbidities, smoke, are obese, and/or do not engage in \nphysical activity.183 Analysis of data from oth er studies, including the \nNational Health Interview Survey , showed similar results.184-187 Separate \nsurveys by the ACS and the CDC  found that 9.3% and 17% of survivors \nsmoke, respectively.186,188 In addition, many survivors forego \nrecommended cancer screenings (ie, co lorectal and cervical screening) \nand follow -up surveillance189-191 or demand more intense surveillance than \nevidence sup ports.84 \nHealthy Lifestyles  \nHealthy lifestyle habits, such as enga ging in routine physical activity, \nmaintaining a healthy diet and weight, and avoiding cigarette/ tobacco use, \nhave been associated with improved health outcomes and quality of life. \nFor some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been associated with a reduced \nrisk of recurrence and death .192-199 In fact, the maintenance of a healthy \nlifestyle is associated with a decrease in premature death in cancer \nsurvivors.200 Therefore,  survivors should be encouraged to achieve and \nmaintain a healthy lifestyle , including  attention to weight management, \nphysical  activity, metabolic health, and dietary habits.  Setting incremental \ngoals for diet, physical activity, and weight management  should be \nadvised . Survivors should be counseled to limit alcohol intake and avoid or \nstop using cigarette/ tobacco products, with emphasis on tobacco \ncessation if the survivor is  a current smoker or user of smokeless tobacco \n(see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).201 Clinicians should also advise survivors to practice sun \nsafety habits  as appropriate, such as using a broad -spectrum sunscreen, \navoiding peak sun hours, and using physical barriers.

They \ncan be used to optimize health and wellness for all survivors; however, they were created to assist health care professionals who work with survivors \nof adult-onset cancer in the post-treatment period, including those in both the oncology and primary care practices. \n\u2022 The panel recognizes that many of the post-treatment issues covered in these Guidelines are best addressed before cancer treatment begins so that \nmany problems can be prevented or minimized.\n\u2022 These guidelines are designed to provide a framework for the general survivorship care and management of potential long-term and/or late effects of \ncancer and its treatment that survivors may experience.\n\u2022 The NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship should be used as a supplement to the follow-up recommendations within the disease-specific guidelines. See \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site and NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care for recommendations regarding metastatic disease. \n\u2022 These guidelines, with the appropriate disease-specific guideline, provide a framework for the coordination of care between the survivor's health care \nproviders to ensure that needs are appropriately addressed.\n\u2022 The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be addressed at every visit. The panel recommends periodic screening assessments and \nappropriate follow-up care as clinically indicated. \n\u2022 Referral to other health care disciplines/providers or community resources may be used to address several indications or identified issues with one \nintervention (eg, rehabilitation for fatigue, depression, and pain).\n\u2022 The panel recommends stakeholders ensure the implementation of guideline-concordant survivorship care within their unique health \nsystems.1  Specifically, institutions are encouraged to determine how to systematically deliver the six key components of survivorship care \n(SURV-1).1-3 There are several models of care that frame the implementation of survivorship care according to provider type(s), clinic type(s), \npatient risk, and other factors.4-7 Engaging these models of care will facilitate implementation planning.7 Panel members recommend \ninstitutions provide the resources necessary to plan, deliver, and evaluate their survivorship care program(s).1-2\n\u2022 For survivorship issues related to younger populations, also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and the \nChildren's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers  \n(www.survivorshipguidelines.org).\n\u2022 For survivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune-mediated toxicities is warranted.

This increased risk is due to genetic susceptibilities (eg, \nhereditary cancer syndromes) and/or family history, shared etiologic exposures (eg, smoking, environmental exposures, health behaviors, \nhuman papillomavirus [HPV]), and mutagenic effects of cancer treatment. Health behaviors should be modified as possible (eg, smoking \ncessation, weight management) to decrease the risk of subsequent malignancies.\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyle and behavioral counseling are important to reduce risk factors that may contribute to subsequent cancers (HL-1).\n\u2022 Treatment-related subsequent primary cancers vary with the type and intensity of anticancer treatment and are associated in particular with \nRT and specific chemotherapeutic agents. For recommendations for screening considerations, s ee Principles of Screening for Treatment-\nRelated Subsequent Primary Cancers (SURV-C).\n\u2022 Screening for subsequent primary cancers should be a shared responsibility between primary and oncology care physicians. For survivors \nliving with metastatic disease, recommendations for screening should be tailored to the survivor's individualized risk and disease status.  \n(See the NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, and Risk Reduction  ). \n\u2022 Evidence suggests that excess lifetime radiation exposure from CT imaging may be associated with a mildly increased risk of developing a \nradiation-associated cancer. Use of radiologic studies to screen for recurrent cancer should be based on diagnosis and evidence that early \ndetection of recurrence will improve cancer-related outcomes. Recommendations for surveillance imaging modality and frequency can be \nfound in the NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site.\n\u2022 For familial assessment considerations that impact screening, see SURV-5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddc2d7bd-ec9a-4cee-b101-56b5a02e93b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddc2d7bd-ec9a-4cee-b101-56b5a02e93b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c61fe6ae-d48b-4fe4-bae2-c14d083b6f7a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "8824cc562ed4814498cc86c5814e902d417010da27030cbb15a125382b322f5d"}}, "hash": "8824cc562ed4814498cc86c5814e902d417010da27030cbb15a125382b322f5d", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Healthy Lifestyles\n\n\nHL-1GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLES\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyle habits have been associated with improved overall health and quality of life. For some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been \nassociated with a reduced risk of recurrence and death. \n\u2022 Cancer prehabilitation1,2 is appropriate for many newly diagnosed survivors prior to initiating treatment with surgery or chemotherapy. \nReferrals to physical therapy or exercise oncology specialists should be considered.\n\u2022 For optimal health, all survivors should be encouraged to set incremental as well as ultimate goals for diet, physical activity, and weight \nmanagement. At a minimum all survivors should be encouraged to:\n\u0017Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight throughout life (SNWM-2).\n\u0017Avoid inactivity.\n\u0017Engage in physical activity (eg, exercise, take the stairs, park in the back of parking lot) daily (SPA-1).\n\u0017Maintain a healthy diet high in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.\n\u0017Limit intake of red and cured meats and highly processed foods,a,b particularly those high in fats and sugars (SNWM-1).\n\u0017Drink alcohol sparingly if at all (SNWM-1). \n\u0017Discontinue use of cigarettes, other tobacco products (including hookah), and e-cigarettes (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation) .\n\u0017Practice sun safety\n \u25caUtilize a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 that protects against UVA and UVB rays and is water resistant.\n \u25caApply sunscreen generously and reapply every 2 hours or after swimming/excessive sweating.\n \u25caConsider using physical barriers whenever possible (ie, hats, shirts with sleeves, avoiding direct sun during peak hours).\n \u25caDo not use tanning beds.\n \u25caAvoid sunburns.\n \u25caSeek shade and wear protective clothing (ie, hats and long-sleeved garments) if outside for prolonged periods of time or during peak \ndirect sun hours.\n\u0017Strive for at least 7\u20139 hours of sleep on a regular basis (SSD-1).3\n \u25caYounger adults require more sleep.4\n \u25caTeenagers may require 9 or more hours of sleep.4\n\u0017Follow up with PCP regularly.\n \u25caAdhere to age-appropriate and treatment-associated health screening, preventive measures (SIMIN-1), and cancer screening \nrecommendations (NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, & Risk Reduction) .\n\u0017Obtain nutrients from food sources rather than relying on dietary supplements.

If detected \nearly, treatment for a late effect may reduce its \nimpact on your life.\nCancer surveillance\nCancer that was thought to be cured can \nreappear on tests. The return of cancer is \ncalled a recurrence or relapse. Survivorship \ncare includes routine checking for a recurrence. \nThis is called surveillance. Surveillance often \nincludes updating your health history and a \nphysical exam. Some survivors get blood tests \nor imaging like x-rays or scans.\nScreening for cancer\nCancer screening is routine testing of cancer \nor pre-cancer conditions. The aim is to detect \ncancer at an early stage when treatment works \nbest. There is screening for prostate, breast, \ncervical, skin, lung, and colorectal cancers. \nScreening is started when there is an average \nor high risk of cancer. Ask your health care \nprovider what screening, if any, you need.\nSurvivors have a higher risk of a new (second) \ncancer. Ask your health care provider about \nyour chance of getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some causes of a first cancer may be \nrelated to getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some cancer treatments may increase \ncancer risk. Such treatments include \nradiation therapy, certain chemotherapies, \nand certain targeted therapies. \u0086Excess radiation from a lifetime of \ncomputed tomography (CT) scans slightly \nincreases cancer risk. Ask your provider if \nthese scans are needed and for how long.\nSome survivors are at risk of hereditary \ncancers. Hereditary cancer is caused by \nabnormal genes that are passed down from \nparents to children. Cancers that can be \nhereditary include breast, ovarian, colorectal, \nand prostate cancer.\nAt health visits, update your health care \nproviders on any new cancers among your \nblood relatives. Your provider may suggest \ngetting genetic testing. A blood sample is \nneeded. You may talk with a genetic counselor \nto discuss your family\u2019s cancer history.\nLate effects\nMany effects of treatment quickly resolve \nafter treatment ends. An example is nausea \nand vomiting. Long-term effects start during \ntreatment and persist after treatment is done. \nLess often, effects start long after treatment \nhas ended. During health visits, your health \ncare providers will assess for such late effects. \nThey will provide treatment for late or long-term \neffects as needed.\nCoordinated care\nCancer survivors often receive care from \nmultiple providers. You may receive care from \noncologists, a primary care provider, and non-\ncancer specialists. Your providers will work \ntogether and clarify their roles to address all \nyour needs.

Health and Human  Services (HHS)  and those on diet and \nphysical activity for the preve ntion of cancer by the ACS .262,263 The panel \nsupports the recommendations by these groups and has adapted them as \nfollows : \n1. Physical activity and exercise recommendations should be tailored to \nindividual survivors\u2019 abilities and preferences.  \n2. Survivors who are able should be encouraged to engage in daily \nphysical activity , including exercise, routine activities, and \nrecreation al activities .  \n3. All survivors should be encouraged to limit sedentary behavior (eg, \nsitting for long periods)  and return to daily activities as soon as \npossible.  \n4. Physical activity for cancer survivors:  \n\u2022 Overall volume of weekly activity should be at least  150 to 300 \nminutes of moderate -intensity activity or 75 minutes of \nvigorous -intensity activity, or an equivalent combination spread \nout over the course of the we ek; \n\u2022 Individuals should engage in 2 to 3 sessions per week of \nstrength training (see Resistance T raining , below) that include \nmajor muscle groups; and  \n\u2022 Major muscle groups should be stretched at least 2 days per \nweek  on days that other exercises are performed .  \n \nThe panel acknowledges that m ost survivors do not meet  these exercise \nrecommendations , and a significant portion reports that they perform no \nleisure -time activity.183,264 However, the evidence suggests that ev en light -\nintensity physical activity can improve physical functioning in survivors.265 \nFor survivors who are inactive, clinicians should not advise the immediate \ninitiation of a high -intensity, hig h-frequency program.266,267 Instead, the \npanel suggests that clinicians provide sufficient information to encourage \nsurvivors to avoid a sedentary lifestyle .253 Survivors and providers should work together to address barriers to physical activity and develop \nincremental short - and long -term physical activity goals. These goals may \ninclude increment al increases in time spent in physical activity or in \nintensity of activity over time. The panel suggested a possible initial \nphysical activity prescription (starting inactive survivors with 1 to 3 light -\n/moderate -intensity sessions of 20 minutes or more p er week), with \nprogression based on tolerance.266 For survivors tolerating the minimum \nguideline recommendations, clinicians should consider encouraging  \nincremental increases in time spent in physical activity or in intensity of \nactivity . Walking and using a s tationary bike are safe for virtually all \nsurvivors.  \nResistance Training  \nThe health benefits of resistance training include improvement in muscle \nstrength and endurance, improvements in functional status, and \nmaintenance/improvement in bone density. Core and strength training is \nimportant to maintain balance and minimize fall r isk.

These guidelines are focused on options to \nmaintain and enhan ce wellness in cancer survivors who are receiving or \nhave completed active therapy, including  those receiving treatment for \nyears, those who may be in remission, and those who are cured. These \nguidelines are designed to provide a framework for the manageme nt of \nlong-term and/or late effects of cancer and its treatment. T he guidelines \nfocus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment \nof cancer can have on the adult survivor's  health,  physical and mental  \nstates, health behaviors, professional and personal identity, sexuality , and \nfinancial standing . \nThe panel acknowledges  that there is a growing population of cancer \nsurvivors with chronic cancer. This group includes those with incurable \ndisease who are receiving  systemic therapy  continuously  and those  who \nmay be  on treatment  intermittently. Although these guidelines do not \naddress the specific needs of survivors with chronic cancer (eg, \npsychosocial issues related to living for years with a terminal diagnosis \nand u ncertainty about the future; how to handle comorbid conditions and \ndisease prevention, screening, and treatment in the setting of limited life \nexpectancy; managing discussions around new drugs and early -stage \nclinical trials ),15 many of the recommendations in these guidelines are relevant to this population (eg, those around fatigue, anxiety, depression ). \nThe panel emphasizes that these guidelines may be used to guide the \nmanagement of all cancer survivors \u2013 not just those who have completed \ntreatment, but also the population with chronic cancer.  \nThese guidelines  should be used as a supplement to the follow -up \nrecommendations within the disease -specific guidelines (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site, available at www.NCCN.org ) \nand should provide a framework for the coordination of care between the \nsurvivor\u2019s health care providers to ensure that needs are appropriately \naddressed.  \nThese guidelines are not intended to provide guidance for the care of \nsurvivors of childhood cancer (detailed guidelines for the care of childhood \ncancer survivors are available from the Children\u2019s Oncology Group at \nhttp://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/ ). For survivorship issues related to \nyounger populations,  please also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent \nand Young Adult  (AYA) Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org ). For \nsurvivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune -\nmediated toxicities is warranted (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nManagement of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nFor this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Surv ivorship, the panel \nfocused on the preventive health issues including healthy lifestyle \nbehaviors, immunizations and prevention of infection, and cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD) risk assessment and modification . The panel also focused \non several common issues  of survivors: 1) anthracycline -induced cardiac \ntoxicity; 2) anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress; 3) cognitive decline; \n4) fatigue; 5) lymphedema; 6) hormone -related symptoms; 7) pain; 8) \nfemale and male sexual dysfunction;  and 9)  sleep disorders.

In the absence of known harm, administration of inactivated vaccines with the \nhope of achieving some protection may be worthwhile.

Vaccines may not trigger \nprotective immune responses in actively immunocompromised individuals or in survivors with residual immune deficits. In addition, certain \nvaccines such as those that are live attenuated (eg, measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) are contraindicated in actively immunosuppressed \nindividuals because of a proven or theoretical increased risk of prolonged shedding and disease from the live organism present in the \nvaccine; other live attenuated vaccines might also be contraindicated in survivors\u2019 close contacts. When other vaccine options exist, they \nshould be preferred over live attenuated vaccines in survivors (eg, recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]). \n\u2022 Ideally, clinicians should have administered all indicated vaccines to patients before initiation of cancer treatment (if possible, at least 2 \nweeks before cancer treatment).d\n\u0017Inactivated or recombinant vaccines should be administered 2 or more weeks before cancer treatment and 3 or more months after cancer \nchemotherapy. While this schedule is preferred, the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) can be administered during cancer treatment. \n\u0017Live viral vaccinese can be administered 4 or more weeks before cancer treatment or 3 or more months after cancer chemotherapy, but \nconsultation with an infectious disease specialist or physician familiar with vaccination in survivors and/or patients with cancer is strongly \nrecommended. \n\u0017COVID-19 vaccine is recommended as appropriate. See NCCN COVID-19 Resources: https://www.nccn.org/covid-19\n\u2022 In survivors who received anti\u2013B-cell antibody therapy, vaccination should be delayed for at least 6 months after chemotherapy and the last \ndose of such therapy.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNIZATIONS", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0070f66-d2c1-487c-86de-1c432f4c1be2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0070f66-d2c1-487c-86de-1c432f4c1be2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa87f797-3388-42db-acb0-5a80639fc6a4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "671c62cc4752f0d6329a000216f2592013b7b08381a1ee4558781aaaf54e95f1"}}, "hash": "671c62cc4752f0d6329a000216f2592013b7b08381a1ee4558781aaaf54e95f1", "text": "Fatigue Cancer-related fatigue\n 7 Fatigue Cancer-related fatigue | Screening\nCancer-related fatigue is distressing. \nRead this chapter to learn more about \nfatigue and the ways to manage it.\nCancer-related fatigue\nMost people have felt tired or fatigued for a \nbrief time.

It is a common effect of \nchemotherapy, radiation therapy, blood stem \n(hematopoietic) cell transplant, and biological \ntherapy. It sometimes occurs after surgery. \nCancer survivors may have mild to moderate \nfatigue for months or years after diagnosis.Screening and assessment\nYour health care provider may screen for \nfatigue on a regular basis. Fatigue screening \ntools consist of a brief scale or survey. There \nis no exam or lab test for fatigue. Fatigue \nscreening helps identify people with fatigue and \nassess treatment results.\nFatigue ranges from mild to severe levels. Your \nprovider will perform an in-depth assessment \nif you have moderate or severe fatigue months \nafter initial treatment. An assessment is also \nneeded if fatigue starts or worsens after \ntreatment ends. \nYour provider will ask you questions. Be ready \nto describe when the fatigue started and \nwhether it\u2019s changed over time. Your provider \nwill also assess for causes of fatigue that can \nbe treated. Some health conditions that cause \nfatigue are listed in Guide 13 .\nYour provider will order blood tests if needed. \nA complete blood count (CBC) with differential \nmeasures parts of the blood, such as red blood \ncells.

(See the NCCN Guidelines for \nCancer-Related Fatigue.)\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR FATIGUE IN CANCER SURVIVORS\n\u2022 Fatigue is a common complaint in individuals undergoing cancer therapy and can be a persistent problem for some cancer survivors in the \nmonths and years after cancer diagnosis. \n\u0017Receipt of chemotherapy, radiation, endocrine, targeted, and/or cellular therapies are predisposing factors for cancer-related fatigue, but it \ncan be seen in some patients who are treated with surgery alone. \n\u0017The time-course of fatigue is unique to the survivor and their treatment plan. However , many cancer survivors report that fatigue may be a \ndisruptive symptom months or years after treatment ends.\n\u0017Fatigue that initially presents months after the completion of adjuvant therapy or fatigue that worsens over this period warrants additional \nevaluation.\n\u2022 Fatigue is a subjective experience that should be systematically assessed using patient self-reports and other sources of data for cancer \nsurvivors in the months and years after diagnosis.\n\u2022 Patients and family/caregiver(s) should be informed that management of fatigue is an integral part of total health care and that fatigue can \npersist following treatment.\n\u2022 Medical care contracts should include reimbursement for the management of fatigue.\n\u2022 Disability insurance should include coverage for the continuing effects of fatigue.\n\u2022  Referral to rehabilitation services including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and physical medicine should be considered for \nsurvivors with fatigue in the months and years after cancer diagnosis.\n\u2022 Also see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

work apply to survivors who are post active treatment as well as persons living \nchronically with cancer. However, discussions about work are ideally best had before treatment begins so that treatment recommendations \ncan take work needs into consideration if possible. \n\u2022 Symptoms affecting work may wax and wane with a survivor\u2019s treatments or disease status, especially if they are living chronically with \ncancer or the consequences of cancer treatment. Some survivors might start and stop working more than once.\n\u2022 Most existing literature focuses on unemployment and/or those who do not return to work. However, underemployment and/or work \nlimitations due to cancer or side effects are also common.\n\u2022 Employment helps to protect survivors from financial toxicity and, at least in the United States, is frequently tied to health insurance access. \nThis can be a main reason survivors work even when/if they are not fully recovered.\n\u2022 Employment is an important source of personal interaction, normalcy , and social support. The psychosocial effects/advantages derived from \nwork may include a sense of purpose, emotional well-being, link to identity , improved quality of life, connection with others, and distraction.\n\u2022 Some populations are at increased risk for difficulties related to work (based on factors such as gender , age, race, ethnicity, cancer type, \ncancer stage, rural residence, educational attainment, etc). The increased difficulties in these populations are more likely for survivors \nwith physically or cognitively demanding jobs or jobs with limited flexibility in scheduling or tasks. Additionally, patients with cancer may \nexperience discrimination as a result of diagnosis/illness, and this may be a consideration for some individuals in decisions surrounding \nemployment.\n\u2022 Survivors should be offered information to help them understand their likely ability to work, take into account their finances and personal/\nfamily needs, and discuss potential work accommodations with their employers.1 \n\u2022 Clinicians should regularly re-evaluate work-related concerns post active cancer treatment or for persons living chronically with cancer .\n\u0017Periodically identify goals and barriers regarding work with survivor  (SWORK-3).\n\u0017A team approach may be needed. Consider early involvement of social work, primary care, physical therapy/occupational therapy, cancer \nrehabilitation, and/or career counseling services, if available.\n\u0017Employment disability forms are not typically well-suited to cancer . However, clinicians should consider the survivor\u2019s needs for flexibility \nin tasks and hours, and other workplace accommodations as a starting point for filling out the necessary forms.

cancer survivors experience persistent fatigue for years \nafter t he completion of active therapy.675-677 In fact, a study of 6011 long-\nterm cancer survivors found that 39% to 51% (depending on tumor type) \nwere classified as fatigued after completion of the Fatigue Assessment \nScale  compared with 21% of a representative normal  population .678  \nPersistent cancer -related fatigue affects quality of life, because individuals \nbecome too tired to fully participate in the roles and activities that make life \nmeaningful.668,6 79 In fact, severe fatigue in survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma \nis associated with a decreased likelihood of employment.680 Disability -\nrelated issues are also relevant for cancer survivors, because obtaining or \nretaining disability benefits from insurers is often difficult for patients with \ncancer -related fatigue. Identificati on and management of fatigue remain an \nunmet need for many cancer survivors.  \nThe specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of cancer -\nrelated fatigue are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include pro -\ninflammatory cytokines, hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis \ndysregulation, circadian rhythm desynchronization, skeletal muscle \nwasting, and genetic dysregulation.681-686 Several studies have focused on \nthe cause of fatigue, especially in cancer survivors with no evidence of \nactive disease, and have su ggested that persistent immune system \nactivation and chronic inflammatory processes may be involved.666,687 -689 \nEvidence supporting these mechanisms is limited.  \nScreening for Fatigue  \nAll survivors should be screened for fatigue to ensure that those with \nmoderate to severe fatigue are identified and treated promptly and \neffectively. Because fatigue is a subjective experience, clinicians must rely \non patients\u2019 descriptions of their fatigue level. The panel recommends the \nuse of a severity scale, with survivors being asked, \u201cHow would you rate \nyour fatigue on a scale of 0 t o 10 over the past 7 days?\u201d Alternatively, screening can be performed with patients asked to rate their fatigue as \nnone, mild, moderate, or severe. Scores of 0 to 3 or none to mild fatigue \nrequire no further assessment or interventions; these patients shou ld be \nrescreened at regular intervals. Patients with scores of 4 or greater or \nindicating moderate or severe fatigue should be evaluated further. Studies \nin patients with cancer have revealed a marked decrease in physical \nfunctioning at a reported fatigue level of 7 or higher on the 0 to 10 \nscale.690,691 \nEvaluation for Moderate to Severe Fatigue  \nWhen fatigue is rated as moderate to severe, with a score of 4 to 10, a \nmore focused history and physical examination should be conducted. A \nthorough history is warranted, because the recommended workup for \nfatigue differs according to the timing of fatigue onset in relation to the \ncompletion of active therapy and the presence of predisposing factors and \nother symptoms. Fatigue has a variable natural history, with some patients \ncomplain ing of only mild levels of fatigue even during active therapy and \nothers experiencing severe fatigue for years after treatment completion.  \nIn general, mild to moderate levels of fatigue that persist for 6 to 12 \nmonths after the completion of therapy do not warrant an extensive \nworkup, unless other symptoms are present. Conversely, when moderate \nto severe fatigue begins after or worsens during  this period, or when other \nsymptoms are present, such as pain, pulmonary complaints, or \nunintentional weight loss, a more extensive workup is warranted to screen \nfor the presence of metastatic disease or other comorbidities. Refer ral to a \npulmonologist should be made for pulmonary complaints . \nRegardless of fatigue onset, it is always relevant to screen for common \ncontributing factors such as emotional distress, sleep disturbance, pain, \nand the use of prescriptions or over -the-counter medications or \nsupplem ents.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

The incidence of  chronic pain after surgical treatment varies with the type \nof procedure and is as high as 60% in patients treated with breast surgery \nand 50% in those treated with lung surgery.942 Arthralgias, characterized \nby joint pain and stiffness, occur in roughly half of patients  taking \naromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.950 Pelvic pain \noften oc curs after pelvic radiation, resulting from fractures, fistulae, \nproctitis, cystitis, dyspareunia, or enteritis.942 \nThese NCCN Guidelin es for Survivorship make recommendations for the \nmanagement of seven categories of cancer pain syndromes: neuropathic \npain, chronic pain syndromes (ie, pain syndromes after amputation, neck \ndissection, mastectomy, thoracotomy), myalgias/arthralgias, skelet al pain, \nmyofascial pain, gastrointestinal/urinary/pelvic pain, and postradiation \npain. Recommendations for the p revention and management of  \nchemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in survivors can be \nfound in ASCO\u2019s clinical practice guideline .951 ASCO also has a clinical \npractice guideline  for the management of chronic pain in survivors of adult \ncancers.952  \nScreening for and Assessment of Pain  \nAll cancer  survivors  should be screened for pa in at regular intervals.  If \npain is present , the intensity should be quantified by the survivor. Because \npain is inherently subjective, self -report of pain is the current standard of \ncare for assessment. Intensity of pain should be quantified using a 0 to 10 \nnumeric rating scale, a categorical scale, or a pictorial scale (eg, Wong -\nBaker FACES  Pain Rating Scale ).953-956 In addition, the survivor should be \nasked to describe the characteristics of the pain ( eg, aching, burn ing). \nSevere uncontrolled pain is a medical emergency and should be \naddressed promptly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1d0c9b1-0185-40f5-b673-0a4f926fd5ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1d0c9b1-0185-40f5-b673-0a4f926fd5ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5933dfc7-534a-404f-853a-f6801c72a89a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "43317660a629a51538830b0e446b3052d9d6e831e35d2097a1e33ef4dc1e69b9"}}, "hash": "43317660a629a51538830b0e446b3052d9d6e831e35d2097a1e33ef4dc1e69b9", "text": ".\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Exposure  \n(and body part affected, \nwhere noted)Increased Subsequent Primary Cancer Risk Screening and Early Detection \nRecommendations Comments\nTransplant Conditioning Therapy (RT or chemotherapy) \nHematopoietic Cell \nTransplantation\u2022 May increase the risk for a variety of hematologic \nor solid tumor cancers, including skin cancer, \nmyelodysplatic syndrome/acute myeloid \nleukemia (MDS/AML), liver cancer, cervical \ncancer, or oral cancer\n\u2022 May increase the risk for lymphoproliferative \ndisorders\u2022 CBC if clinically indicated due to \nsigns or symptoms of disease\n\u2022 Adhere to age-appropriate cancer \nscreening recommendations\n\u2022 Consider annual skin exam and/or \ndermatology referral \u2022 Chronic GVHD may increase the risk of \ncertain subsequent malignancies1,2\n\u2022 Counsel on sun safety and regular use of \nsunscreen  \n(at least SPF 30)\n\u2022 Counsel on importance of regular dental \ncheckups\nSystemic Therapy\nAlkylating Agents, \nAnthracyclines, \nEpipodophyllotoxinsHematologic malignancies  \n(eg, AML)CBC if clinically indicated due to \nsigns or symptoms of disease\nAlkylating Agents Bladder cancer Urine cytology if clinically indicated \ndue to signs or symptoms of diseaseWhen given in combination with pelvic \nradiation, risk is increased\nTamoxifen Endometrial cancer Assess vaginal pain or bleeding \nannually; \nIf abnormal uterine bleeding, referral \nto gynecology for consideration of \ntransvaginal ultrasound and biopsyc Very little risk in premenopausal survivors; \nrisk is primarily in postmenopausal survivors \nwith a uterus.\nPARP Inhibitors\nLutetium-octreotideMDS; AML CBC if clinically indicated due to \nsigns or symptoms of diseaseMDS and AML are rare; usually after long-\nterm treatment3,4\n1 Gunduz M, Ozen M, Sahin U, et al.

An international collaborative \nsupports lifelong echocardiograph ic surveillance at least every 5 years in \nsurvivors of childhood cancer treated with anthrac yclines .489 Although the \nfrequency of cardiac assessment using echocardiograms or multigated \nacquisition ( MUGA ) scans in this population has been a matter of debate, \nthere is general support for at least one assessment in children who have \ncompleted anthracycline thera py.490,491 \nA 2014 joint expert consensus statement from the American Society of \nEchocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular \nImaging  recommends  yearly cardiovasc ular assessment  of adult survivors \nafter the completion of potentially cardiotoxic therapy to look for early \nsigns and symptoms o f CVD , with cardiac imaging used at the discretion \nof the clinician.492 The groups recommen d echocardiogra m as the \npreferred imaging modality, when imaging is performed. The report also \nacknowledged the limited data available  to inform their recommendations.  \nIn 2017, ASCO released a c linical practice guideline  for the prevention and \nmonitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult cancers.493 The \nASCO panel gave a moderate -strength recommendation (as based on evidence and the balance between harms and benefits) that \nechocardiogram can be performed for asymptomatic survivors deemed to \nbe at increased risk for  cardiac dysfunction at 6 to 12 months after \ntreatment, including survivors with a history of anthracycline therapy. \nInsufficient evidence prevented the ASCO panel from making a \nrecommendation regarding the frequency and duration of additional \nsurveillance  of survivors who are asymptomatic and who showed no signs \nof cardiac dysfunction on initial assessment.  \nThe NCCN Survivorship Panel defined its screening recommendations \nbased largely on consensus and on the idea that early recognition and \ntreatment of ca rdiotoxicity can allow for earlier interventions that may \nimprove prognosis (discussed below).  \nAssessment for Symptoms of Heart Failure  \nAccording to the 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines, the cardinal manifestations of \nclinical heart failure (Stage C) include dyspne a and fatigue (which may \nlead to limited exercise tolerance) or fluid retention (which may lead to \npulmonary and peripheral edema).494 These symptoms  can lead to \ndecreased functional capacity and affect quality of life. Heart failure \nsymptoms associated with fluid retention may also include orthopnea or \nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Therefore, the panel recommends a \nhistory and physical to look for these symptoms to help identify survivors \nwho might already be symptomatic. These survivors should  undergo \nevaluation with  an echocardiogram . If no evidence of structural heart \ndisease is seen, then a workup for other causes of the  symptoms is \nwarranted with referral to other specialties (eg, pulmonology or cardiology) \nas needed. Symptomatic survivors with evidence of structural heart \ndisease require immediate referral to a cardio -oncologist or cardiologist.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

provider may screen for sleep \nproblems on a regular basis. A brief survey is \nused. An assessment is needed if you may \nhave a sleep-wake disorder.\nAn assessment includes a health history and \nan exam of your body. You may also complete \nbrief surveys about distress, hot flashes, pain, \nand fatigue. Your provider will order blood \ntests if you may have low red blood cell counts \n(anemia) or hormone levels (hypothyroidism). \nYou may see a sleep expert for further \nevaluation.\nIt is common to complete a sleep diary or wear \na tracking device. These tools are helpful for \nassessing sleep patterns. In the diary, you will \nrecord your bedtime, time you fell asleep, and \nthe time you got up for the day. Your diary will \nalso need to include if you woke up during the \nnight and for how long. Diaries also capture daytime naps. Your provider will ask about any \nstrategies you use to fall or stay asleep.\nA sleep study is sometimes needed to measure \nsleep. It is also called polysomnography. It \ndetects sleep-wake disorders like sleep apnea, \nnarcolepsy, and restless legs syndrome. A full \nsleep study is often done at a sleep center. \nSome studies for sleep apnea can be done at \nhome with a portable device. \nTreatment that works\nTreatment of sleep-wake disorders often has \nvery good results. Your cancer doctor will treat \nhealth conditions that are related to sleep-\nwake disorders. Such conditions include pain, \nobesity, anemia, heart disease, and hormone \nproblems. Your medications will be adjusted if \nthey affect your sleep. Specific treatments for \nsleep problems are listed in Guide 16 .\nPolysomnography\nA polysomnography is a sleep \nstudy. Sensors will be placed \non your body to detect brain \nwaves, heart rate, blood oxygen, \nbreathing, and movement. While \nyou sleep, a technician will \nmonitor and record your data.

In addition, lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of \nsubsequent primary cancers (eg, smoking cessation, physical activity, \nweight loss) should be encouraged.64 Finally, referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates, such as those with a cancer diagnosis at a young age or with \nmultiple primary cancers , to identify those with a potential increased risk  \nfor subsequent malignancies.65 Family cancer history should be \nperiodically updated to reassess hereditary risk, because it should not be \nassumed that all cancer survivors were assessed at diagnosis. Gen etic \ntesting guidelines and knowledge about hereditary cancer risk evolve over \ntime, and new family diagnoses may occur making periodic assessment \nimportant . Genetic risk assessment is appropriate for all survivors  of \nbreast cancer , epithelial ovarian cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, \npancreatic cancer, and colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed at age \n50 years or younger. Many other survivors of rare cancers, cancers \ndiagnosed at young ages, multiple primary cancers, or those  with one or \nmore relatives with the same or related cancers are also candidates for \nrisk assessment per guidelines from NCCN and other expert groups. Genetic counseling and testing is recommended for appropriate survivors \nbased on results of the risk asse ssment. Referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates when available to identify those with an increased risk for \nsubsequent malignancies. Genetic testing may also provide opportunities \nto identify and r educe risks in relatives of cancer survivors. Several NCCN \nGuidelines (available at www.NCCN.org ) include criteria for genetic ris k \nassessment and testing, and management recommendations for patients \nwith known germline mutations linked to an increased risk for cancer, as \nlisted above in these guidelines.  \nPsychosocial Effects  \nCancer can have positive effects on a significant portion of individuals, \nincluding strengthened relationships, a s ense of gratitude or \nempowerment, and an increased appreciation for life.66-72 Many survivors, \nhowever, experience p sychologic distress  after active treatment, and \nsome experience a combination of positive and ne gative psychologic \neffects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3619a702-3b88-4456-a98d-14ea1989fd7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3619a702-3b88-4456-a98d-14ea1989fd7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e35ca2c-d45f-4365-8348-207a8e660aaa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "55ea3b6f2617b439dd6261d10bd83ca2ceabee8c33c093607d55786b852d230d"}}, "hash": "55ea3b6f2617b439dd6261d10bd83ca2ceabee8c33c093607d55786b852d230d", "text": "Pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV -23/PCV -13) is recommended for all adults \naged \u226565 years and those at any age with immun ocompromising \nconditions.418,419 Pneumococcal vaccination is also recommended for \nsurvivors of lung cancer and those who had lung resection .

Cancer screening is finding cancer \nat early stages when it can be fully removed. \nNewer treatments are more precise and better \nat stopping cancer growth.\nWith better cancer care, people with cancer \nare living longer. As a result, the needs of the \ncancer community have changed. More people \nneed help to recover from cancer and its \ntreatment and to be healthy. \nThe term \u201ccancer survivor\u201d was proposed in \nthe 1980s. The intent of the term was to raise \nawareness of better outcomes and changing \nneeds. A person with cancer is a survivor:\n \u0086starting at the time of diagnosis,\n \u0086during and right after treatment, and\n \u0086through the balance of their life.\nSome people do not like or identify with the \nterm survivor. It is not meant to be a label. Its \npurpose is to identify the community of people \nwith a history of cancer. Having a common term \nis useful for improving the care of survivors.Survivorship care\nThe large and rising number of cancer survivors \nneed survivorship care.

Prevention of new and recurrent  cancers and other late effects  \n2. Surveillance for cancer spread , recurrence, or subsequent cancers  \n3. Assessment of late psychosocial , physical , and immunologic \neffects   \n4. Intervention for consequences of cancer and treatment ( eg, \nmedical problems, symptoms, psy chologic distress,  financial and \nsocial concerns)  \n5. Coordination of care between primary care providers and \nspecialists to ensure that all of the survivor\u2019s health needs are met  \n6. Planning for ongoing survivorship care (see below)  \nIn addition, the IOM report d iscusses the importance of policies that \nensure access to and health insurance coverage for all aspects of \nsurvivorship care, including psychosocial services.  Cancer survivors with \nuntreated distress have poorer compliance with surveillance screenings \nand are less likely to exercise and quit smoking.120 A 2008 IOM report, \n\u201cCancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health \nNeeds, \u201d121 concluded that psychosocial screening and care should be a \npart of the new standard for quality cancer care and should be integrated \ninto routine care across the trajectory of cancer, which inc ludes the period \nafter active treatment . See the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management \n(available at www.NCCN.org ) and Anxiety and Depression  below for \nrecommendations on screening for and treating distress.  \nIn September  2011, the LIVESTRONG Foundation convened a meeting of \nexperts and stakeholders in the survivorshi p field to define essential elements of survivorship care.  After 2 days of consensus building, the \ngroup agreed on the following elements that all medical settings must \nprovide for cancer survivors, either directly or through referral \n(http://images.livestrong.org/downloads/flatfiles/what -we-do/our -\napproach/reports/ee/EssentialElementsBrief.pdf ): \n1. Survivorship care plan, psychosocial care plan, and treatment \nsummary  \n2. Screening for new cancers and surveillance for recurrence  \n3.

Stage 0 lymphedema is the earliest \nstage when there are subtle or no symptoms. \nSwelling starts in stage 1 and gets worse in \nstages 2 and 3. \nLymphedema is common among cancer \nsurvivors. It may occur after surgery or radiation \nto lymph nodes near the armpit, collarbone, \nor groin. It may also occur after procedures \ncalled sentinel node biopsy and lymph node \ndissection. Assessment and referral\nIf you are at risk for lymphedema, your cancer \ndoctor will ask about symptoms at health \nvisits. Lymphedema can occur any time after \ncancer treatment but most often occurs within \n18 months. If symptoms are present, your \ndoctor will ask questions about:\n \u0086How often and severe is the swelling\n \u0086Pain or discomfort\n \u0086Loss of strength, range of motion, or \nmobility\n \u0086Ability to do things you usually do\nTo confirm that you have lymphedema, tests \nare needed to rule out a return or worsening of \ncancer. You then may be referred to a certified \nlymphedema therapist. This therapist may be a \nphysician, an occupational therapist, or physical \ntherapist.\nThe therapist may measure your limb. If not \nmeasured before treatment, the swollen limb \ncan be compared to the normal limb.

In addition, a trial in which 12 hospitals were randomized to usual \ncare or to patient -tailored , automated survivorship care plans found that \nthe receipt of a care pl an was associated with an increase in symptoms, \nconcern about illness, and emotional impact.156 No differences in \nsatisfaction with information or care  were  evident.  \nMore recent population -targeted randomized controlled trials are lending  \nsome support for the benefits of survivorship care planning. One \nrandomized controlled trial tested the role of survivorship care plans in 212 \nlow-income, predominantly Latina survivors of stage 0 \u2013III breast cancer.157 \nSurvivors in the  intervention group received the care plan  with a treatment \nsummary and a 1 -hour counseling session  with a  trained, bilingual, \nbicultural nurse who encouraged patient empowerment; the care plan and \ntreatment summary were also delivered to the health care p roviders  of \nsurvivors in the intervention group. Patient -reported p hysician \nimplementation of recommended survivorship care  (eg, for depression, hot \nflashes), the primary trial outcome, was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group ( P = .003).  Patient adherence to \nrecommended survivorship care , the secondary outcome, was also \ngreater for the intervention group, but did not reach statistical significance \n(P = .07).  Whereas this trial provides support for the benefits of \nsurvivorship care plans, it is impossible to separate the effects of the care \nplan and the intensive counseling session, and the applicability of the \nfindings to other populations is unknown.

Risk is also elevated if the survivor has prior or current \nexposure to endemic infections or epidemics, or has a history of blood \ntransfusion.  \nInterventions for Prevention of Infections  \nInfection in survivors can be prevented by education, antimicrobial \nprophylaxis, and the judicious use of vaccines. For information regarding \nantimicrobial prophylaxis, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Prevention \nand Treatment of Cancer -Related Infections (available online at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nEducation  \nSurvivors should be educated about safe pet care, the avoidance of \nzoonosis, travel precautions, gardening precautions , proper hand hygiene , \nand avoidance of respiratory droplets  during a respiratory virus \npandemic .406-413 Contact with pets did not increase the risk of fever, \nbacteremia, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis in children with acute myeloid \nleukemia  (AML) ,414 and the panel believes that contact with pets is \ngenerally safe for most survivors.

Financial Burden  \nThe LIVESTRONG 2012  Survey found that approximately 33% of working -\nage survivors went into debt and 3% had filed for bankruptcy.105 The ACS  \nStudy of Cancer Survivors II  found that 20% of survivors reported unmet \nfinancial needs.24 A study in Washington state found that patients with \ncancer have a 2.6 -fold increase d risk of bankruptcy.106 In another study, \n38% of patients with stage III colon cancer reported financial hardship  \nresulting from cancer treatment, defined as  accruing debt, selling or \nrefinancing  a home, borrow ing money from friends or family, or \nexperienc ing a \u226520% decline in annual income .107 Another study found \nthat, in addition to the average >$16,000 excess economic burden  that \npatients feel in th e early phases of cancer treatment, survivors (>1 year \nfrom diagnosis) have an average annual excess economic burden  that \nexceeds $4,000.108,109 Much of this excess burden was because of excess \nmedical expenditures. A more r ecent study found that the excess annual \nhealth  care expenditures of cancer survivors averaged about $4400, and \nthat the t otal mean annual direct health care expenditure for cancer \nsurvivors  increased by about $1000 in the period from 2009 to 2010 to the \nperiod from  2015  to 2016 .109 Other recent studies also found  that cancer \nsurvivors have greater out -of-pocket expenses and are more likely to \nexperience material hardship than those without a history of cancer.110,111 \nYounger cancer survivors seem to be particular ly vulnerable to the \nfinancial effects of cancer.111-113 \nClearly, with lost wages and increased expenses, the fin ancial burden on \nmany cancer survivors is great.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6c2290b-b41c-4965-aa87-2484608a56f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6c2290b-b41c-4965-aa87-2484608a56f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d795c71-db58-427d-8090-75f13da1429e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "cca2d62d3127ac8724bce985ade13608ef0754cc9cb5bc3ae0b2a5855d924bf5"}, "2": {"node_id": "9451e776-8205-4765-a3a1-378cf88b65ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "46c4dbaa849464b59f6499910dc63370cef487ccee751f68584ec1efc37858d9"}}, "hash": "1a9868c0b69a558b4535951a22b7f6e026cd65a19eda370337976d35ab8a3ff6", "text": "Recent data suggest that patients \nbelonging to racial and ethnic minorities are more  likely to suffer financial \nhardship after cancer treatment.114,115 Furthermore, the financial burden \nassociated with cancer treatment and survivorship can lower health -\nrelated quality of life , increase  psychologic distress, and impact adherence \nto prescribed medications.116-119", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1ed79ba-10c3-44e2-b2d4-f48bd7fad3fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1ed79ba-10c3-44e2-b2d4-f48bd7fad3fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c8bc471-662d-4817-81e9-132b05141218", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "68cd63599fce45901fe434da20e31fdc602ec790d39212e980daf1000bc170ac"}}, "hash": "68cd63599fce45901fe434da20e31fdc602ec790d39212e980daf1000bc170ac", "text": "The 2001 classification scheme , in contrast,  \nintroduced stages of heart failure beginning before the patient is \nsymptomatic, and emphasize d the importance of prevention in heart \nfailure management.  \nThe panel believes that this revised AHA/ACC  classification is particularly \nrelevant to cardio -oncology populations .

These include survivorship clinics \nwithin academic or community cancer centers, community survivorship \nclinics run by primary care clinicians, and survivorship care in the primary \ncare setting.125-130 In each case, survivorship care is delivered by either \nphysicians or by advanced practice clinicia ns such as nurse \npractitioners .131 Each model has advantages and disadvantages, and no \none model is clearly the best for all situations.  \nWith the population of  cancer survivors g rowing at a rapid pace, the \ndemand for follow -up care is expected to increase. An increasing \nproportion of this care will likely be performed by primary care teams. In \nfact, a systematic review identified specific needs of cancer survivors in \nthe primary c are setting, including psychosocial needs, cancer/survivor \ninformation needs, and medical need s.132 Because studies have shown \nthat primary care providers often do not know how best to care for the \nspecific concerns  and needs of cancer survivors,6,133 -138 education  for \nprimary health  care providers regarding appropriate survivorship care  will \nbe increasingly important.139 \nA study in the Netherlands found that patients with cancer 2 to 5 years \nafter d iagnosis increased their number of consultations with primary care \ncompared with age - and sex -matched controls without cancer by 15% for \ncolorectal cancer ( P < .05), 24% for breast cancer ( P < .001), and 33% for \nprostate cancer ( P < .001).140 These survivors also had mor e chronic \nconditions than controls. Although an American study using the SEER -\nMedicare database showed a smaller increase in primary care use by breast cancer survivors (10% increase in year 4 after diagnosis;  P < \n.05),141 these results show that PCPs are providing a s ubstantial amount \nof survivorship care. In fact, according to IOM analyses of the 2001 and \n2002 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital \nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey, approximately one -third of the more \nthan 36 million cancer -related visits to physicians\u2019 offices were made to \nprimary care.28 Furthermore, a nationally representative survey by NCI  \nand the ACS found that >50% of PCPs provide survivors with cancer -\nrelated follow -up care, often with co -management by oncologists.142 \nIn a survey of survivors regarding their preferences for follow -up care, \nmost participants said t hat the PCP should only provide care if the \nresponsibility was shared with the oncologist.143 One of the reasons \ncommonly cited for this preference was that surv ivors believe their PCPs \nlack the needed expertise to deal with their specific issues.

Common barriers include not having enough time \nto exercise, not hav ing access to an acceptable exercise environment, \nuncertainty about safety of exercise post -treatment, lack of knowledge \nregarding appropriate activities, and physical limitations.250 Alleviation of \npain, fatigue, distress, or nutritional deficits can facilitate the initiation of an \nexercise program.  \nRisk Assessment for Exercise -Induced Adverse Events  \nExercise is considered safe for most survivors .214,215,251 However, a \nsignificant portion of survivors may have comorbid conditions or risk \nfactors that make them unable to safely exercise without trained \nsupervision.252 Therefore, a risk assessment is required for all survivors \nbefore prescribing a specific exercise program.214,253 The type of cancer, \ntreatment modalities received, and the number and severity of \ncomorbidities determine risk levels.251 Thus, disease and treatment \nhistory, late and long -term effects, and comorbidities should be assessed. \nA standardized pre-participa tion screening questionnaire, such as the \nPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone  (PAR-Q+),254 can \nalso be considered to identify patients for whom unsupervised physical \nactivity is likely safe versus those for whom it may pose undue risk.  \nSurvivors with peripheral neuropathy, poor bone health, a rthritis , or \nmusculoskeletal issues  are considered to be at moderate risk for exercise -\ninduced adverse events. Stability , balance,  and gait should be assessed in \nsurvivors with peripheral neuropathy and possibly in survivors with poor \nbone health before they engage  in exercise , and exercise choice should \nbe made based on the results (ie, stationary bike or water aerobics for \nsurvivors with poor balance).  In addition, balance training can be \nrecommended for patients at risk for  falls. Moderate -risk survivors can \noften follow the general recommendations for physical activity; however, medical clearance and/or referrals to trained personnel such as a physical \nor occupational therapist, certified exercise professional , or rehabilit ation \nspecialist can also be considered.
