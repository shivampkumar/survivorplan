habits have been associated with improved overall health and quality of life. For some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been \nassociated with a reduced risk of recurrence and death. \n\u2022 Cancer prehabilitation1,2 is appropriate for many newly diagnosed survivors prior to initiating treatment with surgery or chemotherapy. \nReferrals to physical therapy or exercise oncology specialists should be considered.\n\u2022 For optimal health, all survivors should be encouraged to set incremental as well as ultimate goals for diet, physical activity, and weight \nmanagement. At a minimum all survivors should be encouraged to:\n\u0017Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight throughout life (SNWM-2).\n\u0017Avoid inactivity.\n\u0017Engage in physical activity (eg, exercise, take the stairs, park in the back of parking lot) daily (SPA-1).\n\u0017Maintain a healthy diet high in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.\n\u0017Limit intake of red and cured meats and highly processed foods,a,b particularly those high in fats and sugars (SNWM-1).\n\u0017Drink alcohol sparingly if at all (SNWM-1). \n\u0017Discontinue use of cigarettes, other tobacco products (including hookah), and e-cigarettes (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation) .\n\u0017Practice sun safety\n \u25caUtilize a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 that protects against UVA and UVB rays and is water resistant.\n \u25caApply sunscreen generously and reapply every 2 hours or after swimming/excessive sweating.\n \u25caConsider using physical barriers whenever possible (ie, hats, shirts with sleeves, avoiding direct sun during peak hours).\n \u25caDo not use tanning beds.\n \u25caAvoid sunburns.\n \u25caSeek shade and wear protective clothing (ie, hats and long-sleeved garments) if outside for prolonged periods of time or during peak \ndirect sun hours.\n\u0017Strive for at least 7\u20139 hours of sleep on a regular basis (SSD-1).3\n \u25caYounger adults require more sleep.4\n \u25caTeenagers may require 9 or more hours of sleep.4\n\u0017Follow up with PCP regularly.\n \u25caAdhere to age-appropriate and treatment-associated health screening, preventive measures (SIMIN-1), and cancer screening \nrecommendations (NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, & Risk Reduction) .\n\u0017Obtain nutrients from food sources rather than relying on dietary supplements. Routine use of dietary supplements is not recommended \nfor the purposes of cancer control (SSUP-1).\n\u2022 A multidisciplinary approach (including but not limited to clinicians, physical therapists, dieticians, social workers, and patient navigators) \nshould be utilized to:\n\u0017Assess individual and community-level barriers to meeting the healthy lifestyle recommendations.\n\u0017Support patients in developing strategies to overcome challenges throughout the continuum of survivorship care (from diagnosis to long-\nterm survivorship). \n\u0017Consider specialty referrals to supportive programs offered by medical centers or the community (ie, Livestrong at the YMCA).\nFootnotes (HL-1A)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d403f06-812f-4b70-81ca-1df880e14af7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d403f06-812f-4b70-81ca-1df880e14af7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b0d988f6-0206-48cd-bc6b-c44cdae440f3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "a47e4f92f5e011965ae1a10f977f7cbd7a022caca180032d398f25e8fa0d0ab1"}}, "hash": "a47e4f92f5e011965ae1a10f977f7cbd7a022caca180032d398f25e8fa0d0ab1", "text": "Survivorship  Healthy living\nHealthy living\nCancer survivors can improve their health and \nquality of life with healthy living.

Although achieving all of these healthy lifestyle goals may be \ndifficult for many survivors, eve n small reductions in weight among \noverweight or obese survivors or small increases in physical activity \namong sedentary individuals are thought to yield meaningful \nimprovements in cancer -specific outcomes and overall health.202 Clinicians \nshould assess individual and  community -level barriers to meeting the \nhealthy lifestyle recommendations and support patients in developing \nstrategies to overcome challenges.  \nPhysical Activity  \nDuring cancer treatment, many survivors become deconditioned and can \ndevelop impaired cardiov ascular fitness because of the direct and \nsecondary effects of therapy.203 Randomized trials have shown that \nexercise training is safe, tolerable, and effective for most survivors. \nStructured aerobic and resistance training programs after treatment can \nimprove  cardiovascular fitness and strength and can have positive effects \non balance, body composition, fatigue, emotional well -being, and quality of \nlife.204-216 The effectiveness of exercise is especially well studied in \npatients  with early -stage breast cancer. Survivors of breast cancer who \nexercise have  improved cardiovascular fitness and therefore an increased \ncapacity to perform daily life functions, resulting in a better quality of \nlife.214,215,217 -219 Furthermore, a study of adult survivors of childhood \nHodgkin lymphoma  found that vigorous exercise was associated with a \nreduction in the risk of  major  cardiovascular  event s after a median follow -\nup of 11.9 years.220 In fact, the finding was dose -dependent, and survivors \nwho reported \u22659 metabolic equivalent (MET ) h/wk experienced a 51% \nreduction in risk compared with those reporting <9 MET h/wk (P = .002).  A similar study in patients with breast cancer found a similar reduction in the \nrisk of cardiovascular events  with \u22659 MET h/wk .221 \nIn addition, observational studies have consistentl y found that p hysical  \nactivity is linked to decreased cancer incidence and recurrence and \nincreased survival for certain tumor types.209,222 -239 For example, one meta -\nanalysis of 6 studies including more than 12,000 survivors of breast \ncancer found that post -diagnosis physical activity reduced all -cause \nmortality by 41% ( P < .00001)  and disease recurrence by 24% ( P = \n.00001).226 Data from other meta -analyses primarily consisting of \nobservational studies of survivors of colorectal, ovarian, non -small cell \nlung, brain, prostate, and breast cancers show that physical activity is \nassociated with decreased all -cause mortality and/or cancer -specific \nmortality.224,227,236,240 In fact, analyses of data from 986 survivors of breast \ncancer  from the National Ru nners' and Walkers' Health Studies  found that \nmortality decreased with increased rates of energy expenditure.237 \nEvidence in other disease sites is less robust, but also suggests survival \nbenefits associated with exercise in survivors after treatment.240 \nData also support the idea that inactivity/sedentary behavior is  a risk factor \nfor cancer incidence  and mortality and impacts mood and quality of life in \nsurvivors,  independent of the level of an individual\u2019s recreational or \noccupational physical activity.192,241 -247 For example, i n a cohort of more \nthan 2000 survivors of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, those who spent \nmore leisure time sitting had a higher  mortality than those who spent more \ntime in recreational activity.192 \nEvaluation

A study of NIH \nsurvivorship grants in fiscal year 2016 showed a need for research \nincluding more diverse cancer types, older and longer -term survivors, and \nmore ethnoculturally diverse populations of survivors.181 \nIn June 2012, the ACS , CDC, LIVE STRONG  Foundation , and NCI held a \njoint meeting and created an action plan to facilitate the translation of \nsurvivorship research into survivorship care.182 The plan is driven by \ncollaboration between researchers, survivors, clinicians, and public health \nprofessionals; the use of technology, such as EHRs; analysis of \ninformation from the vie wpoints of multiple stakeholders; and the \nintegration and synthesis of knowledge using systematic reviews and \nmeta -analyses.  Recommendations for Preventive Health  \nAnalysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  \n(BRFSS)  indicates that a  large proportion of cancer survivors have \nsignificant comorbidities, smoke, are obese, and/or do not engage in \nphysical activity.183 Analysis of data from oth er studies, including the \nNational Health Interview Survey , showed similar results.184-187 Separate \nsurveys by the ACS and the CDC  found that 9.3% and 17% of survivors \nsmoke, respectively.186,188 In addition, many survivors forego \nrecommended cancer screenings (ie, co lorectal and cervical screening) \nand follow -up surveillance189-191 or demand more intense surveillance than \nevidence sup ports.84 \nHealthy Lifestyles  \nHealthy lifestyle habits, such as enga ging in routine physical activity, \nmaintaining a healthy diet and weight, and avoiding cigarette/ tobacco use, \nhave been associated with improved health outcomes and quality of life. \nFor some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been associated with a reduced \nrisk of recurrence and death .192-199 In fact, the maintenance of a healthy \nlifestyle is associated with a decrease in premature death in cancer \nsurvivors.200 Therefore,  survivors should be encouraged to achieve and \nmaintain a healthy lifestyle , including  attention to weight management, \nphysical  activity, metabolic health, and dietary habits.  Setting incremental \ngoals for diet, physical activity, and weight management  should be \nadvised . Survivors should be counseled to limit alcohol intake and avoid or \nstop using cigarette/ tobacco products, with emphasis on tobacco \ncessation if the survivor is  a current smoker or user of smokeless tobacco \n(see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).201 Clinicians should also advise survivors to practice sun \nsafety habits  as appropriate, such as using a broad -spectrum sunscreen, \navoiding peak sun hours, and using physical barriers. Survivors should \nalso be encouraged to get an adequate amount of sleep. Finally, survivors \nshould be encouraged to see a PCP regularly and adhere to age -", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f68f414f-40f8-4af9-ab70-30f8623926de": {"__data__": {"id_": "f68f414f-40f8-4af9-ab70-30f8623926de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12653867-8323-4905-9248-32170ba3ca9d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "0782093eb3135356154f30f7ea8f721eedbe52d4c917589614d6133b38c7d331"}, "3": {"node_id": "38ce27c9-798f-4dbd-af51-6207fa97a63f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "4bb09e9391cd8a04bc7322a265aec6f50cdda5e75baad39ade93dc2133cd10b7"}}, "hash": "04cc3e86dd993f26ce3536106157c81909811fae8ff25796017bb624878a1a86", "text": ".\n\n\nHealthy Lifestyles\nHL-1\n\u2022 New bullet added: Cancer prehabilitation is appropriate for many \nnewly diagnosed survivors prior to initiating treatment with surgery \nor chemotherapy.

Health and Human  Services (HHS)  and those on diet and \nphysical activity for the preve ntion of cancer by the ACS .262,263 The panel \nsupports the recommendations by these groups and has adapted them as \nfollows : \n1. Physical activity and exercise recommendations should be tailored to \nindividual survivors\u2019 abilities and preferences.  \n2. Survivors who are able should be encouraged to engage in daily \nphysical activity , including exercise, routine activities, and \nrecreation al activities .  \n3. All survivors should be encouraged to limit sedentary behavior (eg, \nsitting for long periods)  and return to daily activities as soon as \npossible.  \n4. Physical activity for cancer survivors:  \n\u2022 Overall volume of weekly activity should be at least  150 to 300 \nminutes of moderate -intensity activity or 75 minutes of \nvigorous -intensity activity, or an equivalent combination spread \nout over the course of the we ek; \n\u2022 Individuals should engage in 2 to 3 sessions per week of \nstrength training (see Resistance T raining , below) that include \nmajor muscle groups; and  \n\u2022 Major muscle groups should be stretched at least 2 days per \nweek  on days that other exercises are performed .  \n \nThe panel acknowledges that m ost survivors do not meet  these exercise \nrecommendations , and a significant portion reports that they perform no \nleisure -time activity.183,264 However, the evidence suggests that ev en light -\nintensity physical activity can improve physical functioning in survivors.265 \nFor survivors who are inactive, clinicians should not advise the immediate \ninitiation of a high -intensity, hig h-frequency program.266,267 Instead, the \npanel suggests that clinicians provide sufficient information to encourage \nsurvivors to avoid a sedentary lifestyle .253 Survivors and providers should work together to address barriers to physical activity and develop \nincremental short - and long -term physical activity goals. These goals may \ninclude increment al increases in time spent in physical activity or in \nintensity of activity over time. The panel suggested a possible initial \nphysical activity prescription (starting inactive survivors with 1 to 3 light -\n/moderate -intensity sessions of 20 minutes or more p er week), with \nprogression based on tolerance.266 For survivors tolerating the minimum \nguideline recommendations, clinicians should consider encouraging  \nincremental increases in time spent in physical activity or in intensity of \nactivity . Walking and using a s tationary bike are safe for virtually all \nsurvivors.  \nResistance Training  \nThe health benefits of resistance training include improvement in muscle \nstrength and endurance, improvements in functional status, and \nmaintenance/improvement in bone density. Core and strength training is \nimportant to maintain balance and minimize fall r isk. Studies in survivors \nhave shown improvements in lean body mass, muscular function, and \nupper body strength, and a slowing of physical function deterioration .268-273 \nA recent systematic review of 15 studies of r esistance training \ninterventions during and /or after cancer treatment  concluded that \nmeaningful improvements in physiologic and quality -of-life outcomes can \nbe achieved.270 A similar review of 11 randomized controlled trials came to \nsimilar conclusions.273 One recent study that included 2863 cancer \nsurvivors  found resistance exercise to be associated  with a 33% lower risk \nof all -cause mortality (95% CI, 0.45 \u20130.99) , independent of aerobic \nexercise.274 \nAll major muscle groups (chest, shoulders, arms, back, core, and legs) \nshould be incorporated into a resistance training program. For survivors \nwho do not currently engage in resistance training, referral to train ed \npersonnel or an exercise specialist is recommended if available .

For instance, results of a \nrandomized controlled trial, in which 4282 wo men were randomly assigned \nto a Mediterranean diet with olive oil, a Mediterranean diet with mixed \nnuts, or a control low-fat diet, suggest that the olive oil/Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13 \u2013\n0.79).337 In the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI)  Dietary Modification trial , \nnearly 49,000 postmenopausal individuals  with a history of breast cancer  \nand with a dietary fat intake of \u226532% of energy were randomized 3:2 to  a \nusual diet group or a dietary intervention group .338 After an average follow -\nup of 8.1 years, 655 (0.42%) individuals  in the intervention group and 1072  \nindividuals (0.45%) in the comp arison group developed invasive breast \ncancer (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83 \u20131.01).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4a6733d-7760-48a0-910f-f68b93d66d73": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4a6733d-7760-48a0-910f-f68b93d66d73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac44d621-5203-4f32-b26e-8597fdac1de6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "fb428f5c85551f6afc82be24441dd47ef9e77b13ccf06bcb8c6ab9338e1ca681"}}, "hash": "fb428f5c85551f6afc82be24441dd47ef9e77b13ccf06bcb8c6ab9338e1ca681", "text": "Food and supplements  Food goals\nFood goals\nCancer survivors who eat healthful foods are \nmore likely to have better outcomes.

You can overeat even if \nyou eat only healthful food. Track your calories \nto learn how many calories are in foods and to \nprevent overeating.\nPlant-based food\nPlant-based food is made from vegetables, \nlegumes, fruits, grains, nuts, seeds, or oils. In \ngeneral, a healthy diet is rich in plant sources. \nAim for at least half of your diet to be plant-\nbased food. Most of your plant-based food \nshould be vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.Soy foods are made from soybeans, which \nare also called edamame. There is no proof \nfrom large studies that soy causes poor cancer \noutcomes. Eating 3 or fewer servings of soy a \nday is safe.\nAnimal-based food\nAnimal-based food is made from meat, poultry, \nfish, eggs, milk, or honey. Half or less of your \ndiet can be animal-based food. Fish and poultry \nare healthy choices. Eat limited amounts of red \nmeats and avoid processed meats.\nProcessed food\nProcessed food is food that has been changed \nfrom its natural state. There are classes of \nprocessed food.\n \u0086Minimally processed foods have been \nslightly changed to make prepping and \ncooking easier.\n \u0086Processed foods have added fats, sugar, \nor salt.\n \u0086Ultra-processed foods have artificial colors \nand flavors and preservatives.\nLimit eating of processed and ultra-processed \nfood. Drinks with lots of added sugars or fats \nshould be consumed in small amounts.\nAlcohol\nCancer survivors should limit or avoid \nconsuming alcohol. The amount of alcohol \nthat is safe depends on a person\u2019s biology and \nthe cancer type. Cisgender research supports \n1 drink for women and 2 drinks for men. \nSurvivors of liver, esophageal, kidney, and head \nand neck cancers should not drink alcohol due \nto a higher chance of death.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54cc2efc-a446-43c6-906e-b96629ed60ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "54cc2efc-a446-43c6-906e-b96629ed60ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18be062f-8509-4816-8591-fe6754505c09", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "9edcb2374e6bbf248d3748d0357ca3c18b522a98026935d16209ae72a09f6948"}, "3": {"node_id": "356af358-2179-4892-994c-1c59ce2c6ded", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "c1b24607da79069d705cb0caa481c81783c65032960ae18959c0ac8ffeede015"}}, "hash": "82460fcbb54d98038c64ef9411987db48fd1d976a88935c1d6a866e922a1d73f", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-19 with better outcomes is less robust. A study of 1901 survivors of early -\nstage breast cancer found that a diet higher in fruit s, vegetables, whole \ngrains, and poultry and lower in red and processed meats and refined \ngrains  resulted in a decreased risk of overall death and death from no n-\nbreast cancer causes, but was not associated with risk of breast cancer \nrecurrence or death from breast cancer .346  \nUnfortunately, cancer survivors often do not follow recommendation s for a \nhealthy diet and, in some studies, show worse patterns than non -cancer \ncontrols.347,348 For example, a national survey of 1533 adult cancer \nsurvivors  and 3075  matched c ontrols found that cancer survivors had \nworse dietary patterns.348 Other studies show that survivors may make \nimprovement s to their diet quality post -diagnosis.349-351  \nRecommendations for Nutrition in Survivors  \nAll survivors should be encouraged to make informed choices about food \nto ensure variety and an adequate nutrient intake. Recommendations  for \nfood sources in a healthy diet are included in the guidelines. In general, a \nhealthy diet is rich in plant sources, such as vegetables, fruits, whole \ngrains, legumes, olive or canola oil, avocados, seeds, and nuts. Fish and \npoultry are recommended, wh ereas red meats should be limited  and \nprocessed meats avoided. Other processed foods and foods and \nbeverages with high amounts of added sugars and/or fats should also be \nlimited.  Other nutrition recommendations for survivors include eating a diet \nthat is a t least 50% plant -based, with the majority of food being \nvegetables, fruit, and whole grains, and tracking calorie intake. Self -\nmonitoring of caloric intake has been shown to be an effective strategy for \nweight management.352,353 \nIn addition, survivors should be advised to avoid alcohol, or if partaking, \nlimit alcohol intake to one drink per day for a 2000 -calorie daily diet  and \ntwo drin ks per day for a 2000 -calorie daily diet .212 This is especially import ant for survivors of liver, esophageal, kidney, and head and neck  \ncancers, who should refrain from alcohol due to an increased risk of \nmortality with alcohol consumption.341,354,355 Survivors of breast cancer do \nnot need to be advised to refrain completely from alcohol consumption, \nbecause it has no proven impact on outcomes, but should adhere to \ngeneral population recommendations.341,356,357 \nCurrently, no consensus regarding the role of soy foods in cancer control \nexists. Several large studies have found no adverse effects on breast \ncancer recurrence or total mortality related to the intake of soy food.358-362 \nIn fact, trends towards decreased recurrence and mortality were observed. \nThe panel therefore considers moderate consumption of soy foods ( \u22643 \nservings a day) to be prudent.  \nFor patie nts desiring further recommendations for dietary guidelines , a \nreferral to a dietitian  or nutritionist should be considered.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "356af358-2179-4892-994c-1c59ce2c6ded": {"__data__": {"id_": "356af358-2179-4892-994c-1c59ce2c6ded", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18be062f-8509-4816-8591-fe6754505c09", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "9edcb2374e6bbf248d3748d0357ca3c18b522a98026935d16209ae72a09f6948"}, "2": {"node_id": "54cc2efc-a446-43c6-906e-b96629ed60ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "82460fcbb54d98038c64ef9411987db48fd1d976a88935c1d6a866e922a1d73f"}}, "hash": "c1b24607da79069d705cb0caa481c81783c65032960ae18959c0ac8ffeede015", "text": "The USDA \napproximate food plate volumes ( www.choosemyplate.gov ) are:   \n\u2022 Vegetables and fruits should comprise half the volume of food on \nthe plate (30% vegetables; 20% fruit)  \n\u2022 Whole grains  should comprise 30% of the plate  \n\u2022 Protein  should comprise 20% of the plate  \nSources of dietary components : \n\u2022 Fat: plant sources such as olive or canola oil, avocados, seeds \nand nuts, and fatty fish  \n\u2022 Carbohydrates: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes  \n\u2022 Protein: poultry, fish, legumes, low-fat dairy foods,  and nuts  \n \nThe use of healthy recipes, such as those found in re sources such as the \nACS\u2019s \u201cFind Healthy Recipes\u201d website, \nhttp://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/eathealthy/findhealthyre\ncipes/index , should be encouraged.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80e07840-f962-45ae-a473-581fdb7c2f97": {"__data__": {"id_": "80e07840-f962-45ae-a473-581fdb7c2f97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "606f816c-af45-490c-afe9-3a4439d50d93", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "856516a68dbe5bb60714ade588680a09954040f70bc78818ea7b7eb0aea72b4d"}}, "hash": "856516a68dbe5bb60714ade588680a09954040f70bc78818ea7b7eb0aea72b4d", "text": ".\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Exposure  \n(and body part affected,  \nwhere noted)Increased Subsequent \nPrimary Cancer RiskScreening and Early Detection \nRecommendations Comments\nRadiation Therapy, Including Total Body Irradiation (TBI)\u2013Continued\nMantle/Chest Breast cancer  \n(assigned female at birth)aBreast MRI and mammogram annually, \nstarting at age 30 or 8 years after radiation, \nwhichever occurs last, for exposure \u226510 \nGy and <30 years old.

In fact, antibody titers to vaccine -preventable diseases \ndecrease after anti -cancer treatment.399,400 In addition, survivors are at \nincreased risk of complications from vaccine -preventable diseases, such \nas those caused by HPV and influenza viruses.400,401  \nMany infections in survivors can be prevented by the use of vaccines. \nHowever, data from the BRFSS found that 42% of survivors did not \nreceive an influenza vaccinati on in 2009, and 52% reported never \nreceiving a pneumococcal vaccination.183 Analysis of the SEER -Medicare \ndatabase showed that survivors  of breast cancer, aged  \u226565 years, were \nless likely to receive an influenza vaccination than matched non -cancer \ncontrols.141 A separate analysis of the SEER -Medicare database by \nanother group found similar results.402 \nVaccines represent a unique challenge in cancer and transplant survivors, \nbecause they may or may not trigger the desired protective immune \nresponses due to possible residual immune deficits.403-405 In addition, certain vaccines, such as those that are live attenuated (eg, zoster [ZVL, \nMMRV, or VAR]; MMR), are contraindicated in active ly \nimmunosuppressed survivors because of an increased risk of developing \nthe disease and/or prolonged shedding of the live organism given in the \nvaccine.  \nRisk Assessment and Screening for Immunizations and Prevention of \nInfections  \nSurvivors are at elevated risk for infections if their cancer treatment \nincluded chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab, \nalemtuzumab), radiation, corticosteroids, splenectomy,  CAR T -cell \ntherapy , and/or HCT (which includes peripheral blood stem cell \ntransplanta tion, bone marrow transplantation, and cord blood \ntransplantation). Risk is also elevated if the survivor has prior or current \nexposure to endemic infections or epidemics, or has a history of blood \ntransfusion.  \nInterventions for Prevention of Infections  \nInfection in survivors can be prevented by education, antimicrobial \nprophylaxis, and the judicious use of vaccines. For information regarding \nantimicrobial prophylaxis, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Prevention \nand Treatment of Cancer -Related Infections (available online at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nEducation  \nSurvivors should be educated about safe pet care, the avoidance of \nzoonosis, travel precautions, gardening precautions , proper hand hygiene , \nand avoidance of respiratory droplets  during a respiratory virus \npandemic .406-413 Contact with pets did not increase the risk of fever, \nbacteremia, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis in children with acute myeloid \nleukemia  (AML) ,414 and the panel believes that contact with pets is \ngenerally safe for most survivors.

This assessment can be done by the oncologist or \nPCP. Shared , coordinated care between the oncology , primary care , and \nsubspecialty care  provider s is encouraged.  Depending on the cancer type \nand stage of disease, transition of care to primary care may be done when \ndeemed clinically appropriate, with referral back to oncologic care as \nneeded. The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be \naddressed at every visit.  \nSome tools that screen for long -term and late physical and psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment in survivors  have been validated.171-176 \nIn addition, the NCCN Survivorship Panel  created a sample screening \ninstrument  that is guideline -specific and can be self-administered or \nadministered by an interviewer .

For additional information about fatigue in survivors and \npatients with cancer, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer -Related \nFatigue (available at www.NCCN.org ). These guidelines may be modified \nto fit the individual survivor\u2019s circumstance s. \nTreatment of Contributing Factors  \nManagement of fatigue in survivors first includes the treatment of \ncontributing factors such as pain, distress, anemia, and sleep disturbances \n(more information on  the treatment of pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep \ndisorders in survivors can be found throughout these guidelines). In a \nrandomized controlled trial of 152 fatigued patients with advanced cancer, \ntreatment of accompanying physical symptoms, including pain, nausea, \nvomiting, and shortness of breath, resulted  in a significantly higher impact \non general fatigue, activity, and motivation than usual care.692 \nPatient and Family Education and Counseling  \nEducation and counseling can be beneficial in helping patients cope with \nfatigue. Understanding typical patterns of fatigue during and after \ntreatment can help patients set reasonable expectations regarding \nimprovements in energy after the completion of can cer therapy and can \nhelp allay concerns that persistent fatigue after the completion of therapy \nis evidence of disease recurrence. Counseling can help patients develop \nstrategies for self -monitoring of fatigue and techniques such as energy conservation tha t may be helpful in the immediate post -treatment \nperiod.693 \nPhysical Activity  \nActivity en hancement is a category 1 recommendation for the \nmanagement of fatigue in survivors. Improving strength, energy, and \nfitness through regular exercise, even a moderate -intensity walking \nprogram, has been shown to facilitate the transition from patient to \nsurvivor, decrease anxiety and depression, improve body image, and \nincrease tolerance for physical activity. Therefore, survivors with moderate \nto severe fatigue should be encouraged to maintain adequate levels of \nphysical activity (category 1). Robust data support the efficacy of \nincreased physical activity for reducing fatigue in patients with cancer and \nsurvivors.204,210,215,217,219,560,694 -700 Multiple meta -analyses of randomized \ncontrolled trials have found that cancer survivors who participate in \nexercise interventions, either during or after treatment for cancer, \nexperience significant improvements in fatigue com pared with patients \nrandomized to the control group.204,700 -703 A randomized phase 3 trial that \nincluded 410 cancer survivors showed that a 4-week yoga therapy \nprogra m led to impro vements in fatigue and sleep quality and reductions in \ndaytime dysfunction .704 \nSurvivors at a higher risk of injury should be referred to a physical \ntherapist or exercise specialist (also see Healthy Lifestyles , above ). \nPsychosocial and Other Interventions  \nPsychosocial int erventions, such as CBT, MBSR, psycho -educational \ntherapy, and supportive expressive therapy, including support groups, \ncounseling, and journal writing (all category 1 recommendations), have \nalso been shown to reduce fatigue in cancer survivors, although d ata are \nnot entirely consistent.567,705 -710 Several meta -analyses have evaluated the \nrole of psychosocial interventions in reducing fatigue.700,705,709,711 For", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96f6ee5b-b86c-48c4-a2b4-1f2febf54e27": {"__data__": {"id_": "96f6ee5b-b86c-48c4-a2b4-1f2febf54e27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c21f93af-30ca-42ff-a7f0-fcdc75a82f88", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-crl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-01"}, "hash": "52d41250f11b2a66666c78da6018fdd77892ed0e15f6b24ee8d5e349c80f2317"}}, "hash": "52d41250f11b2a66666c78da6018fdd77892ed0e15f6b24ee8d5e349c80f2317", "text": "Survivorship  Survivorship care\nthat lowers hormone levels to reduce the \nchance of getting cancer.\nBesides cancer, other unwanted effects of \ntreatment and cancer can occur after treatment. \nA goal of survivorship care is to lower your \nchance of having these late effects. If detected \nearly, treatment for a late effect may reduce its \nimpact on your life.\nCancer surveillance\nCancer that was thought to be cured can \nreappear on tests. The return of cancer is \ncalled a recurrence or relapse. Survivorship \ncare includes routine checking for a recurrence. \nThis is called surveillance. Surveillance often \nincludes updating your health history and a \nphysical exam. Some survivors get blood tests \nor imaging like x-rays or scans.\nScreening for cancer\nCancer screening is routine testing of cancer \nor pre-cancer conditions. The aim is to detect \ncancer at an early stage when treatment works \nbest. There is screening for prostate, breast, \ncervical, skin, lung, and colorectal cancers. \nScreening is started when there is an average \nor high risk of cancer. Ask your health care \nprovider what screening, if any, you need.\nSurvivors have a higher risk of a new (second) \ncancer. Ask your health care provider about \nyour chance of getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some causes of a first cancer may be \nrelated to getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some cancer treatments may increase \ncancer risk. Such treatments include \nradiation therapy, certain chemotherapies, \nand certain targeted therapies. \u0086Excess radiation from a lifetime of \ncomputed tomography (CT) scans slightly \nincreases cancer risk. Ask your provider if \nthese scans are needed and for how long.\nSome survivors are at risk of hereditary \ncancers. Hereditary cancer is caused by \nabnormal genes that are passed down from \nparents to children. Cancers that can be \nhereditary include breast, ovarian, colorectal, \nand prostate cancer.\nAt health visits, update your health care \nproviders on any new cancers among your \nblood relatives. Your provider may suggest \ngetting genetic testing. A blood sample is \nneeded. You may talk with a genetic counselor \nto discuss your family\u2019s cancer history.\nLate effects\nMany effects of treatment quickly resolve \nafter treatment ends. An example is nausea \nand vomiting. Long-term effects start during \ntreatment and persist after treatment is done. \nLess often, effects start long after treatment \nhas ended. During health visits, your health \ncare providers will assess for such late effects. \nThey will provide treatment for late or long-term \neffects as needed.\nCoordinated care\nCancer survivors often receive care from \nmultiple providers. You may receive care from \noncologists, a primary care provider, and non-\ncancer specialists. Your providers will work \ntogether and clarify their roles to address all \nyour needs. Over time, your primary care \nprovider will resume charge over your health \ncare.

It should also \nbe determined whether or not the insomnia symptoms are causing \ndistress,  impacting daytime functioning, or affecting the survivor\u2019s quality \nof life.  \nManagement of Sleep Disorders  \nIn all cases, comorbidities that may be contributing to the sleep disorder \nshould be addressed. Survivors should also be advised that sleepiness \ncan increase the risk of accidents, including while operating a motor \nvehicle. In addition, several types of interventions are recommended, as \ndescribed below.1173,1201,1202 Referral to a sleep specialist can be \nconsidered in most cases , especially for OSA, RLS, parasomnias, \ncircadian rhythm disorders, narcolep sy, and chronic or refractory \ninsomnia . Referral to a PCP can also be considered, except in cases of \ncircadian rhythm disorder , prolonged wakefulness or awakenings , \nprolonged nocturnal sleep (ie, >9 hours for adults) , cataplexy, frequent \nshort naps, vivid dreams,  disrupted sleep, or sleep paralysis, in which \ncases a sleep specialist is recommended.  \nSleep Hygiene Education  \nEducating survivors about general sleep hygiene is recommended, \nespecially for the treatment of  circadian rhythm disorders,  insomni a, and \nexcessive sleepiness associated with insufficient sleep time .1203 -1205 Key \npoints are listed in the guidelines and include regular mornin g or afternoon physical activity ; daytime exposure to bright light; keeping the sleep \nenvironment dark, quiet, and comfortable; and avoid ing heavy meals, \nmoderate to strenuous physical activity, alcohol, and nicotine near \nbedtime.  However, sleep hygiene al one is insufficient for the effective \nmanagement of sleep disorders.  \nPhysical Activity  \nPhysical activity  can improve sleep in middle -aged and older individuals in \nnon-cancer settings.1206 -1208 Physical activity may also improve sleep in \npatients with cancer and survivors.210,1209 -1214 One randomized controlled \ntrial compared a standardized yoga intervention plus standard care with \nstandard care alone in 410 survivors (75% breast cancer; 96% women) \nwith moderate to severe sl eep disruption.1211 Participants in the yoga arm \nexperienced greater improvements in global and subjective sleep quality, \ndaytime function ing, and sleep efficiency (all P \u2264 .05).

One medium cookie has about \n2 tsp of sugar; a 12-oz can of a soft drink has about 10 tsp.\n\u0017Track calorie intake. \n \u25caSelf-monitoring of food and beverage intake has been shown to be an effective strategy for weight management. \n \u25caProlonged periods of fasting may impair adequate caloric and nutrient intake. \n\u0017Drink alcohol sparingly if at all.2,d Lower levels of alcohol consumption are associated with a lower risk of cancer. \n\u2022 For patients desiring further recommendations for dietary guidelines:\n\u0017Consider referral to a registered dietitian or nutritionist.\n\u0017The USDA approximate food plate volumes (https://www.myplate.gov) are: \n \u25caVegetables and fruits should comprise half the volume of food on the plate\n \u25caVegetables: 30% of plate; fruits 20% of plate\n \u25caWhole grains: 30% of plate\n \u25caProtein: 20% of plate\n\u2022 Recommended sources of dietary components:\n\u0017Fat: plant sources such as olive or canola oil, avocados, seeds and nuts, and fatty fishe\n\u0017Carbohydrates: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes\n\u0017Protein: poultry, fish, legumes, low-fat dairy foods, and nuts\n\u2022 While the risks and benefits of soy foods for cancer survivors have been debated for many years, most studies to date show that moderate \nconsumption of soy foods (up to 3 servings per day) are beneficial in promoting overall health and survival, with the strongest evidence \nexisting for the prevention of lung cancer and reduction of breast cancer recurrence.f,3 \nFootnotes (SNWM-1A)", "start_char_idx":

Common barriers include not having enough time \nto exercise, not hav ing access to an acceptable exercise environment, \nuncertainty about safety of exercise post -treatment, lack of knowledge \nregarding appropriate activities, and physical limitations.250 Alleviation of \npain, fatigue, distress, or nutritional deficits can facilitate the initiation of an \nexercise program.  \nRisk Assessment for Exercise -Induced Adverse Events  \nExercise is considered safe for most survivors .214,215,251 However, a \nsignificant portion of survivors may have comorbid conditions or risk \nfactors that make them unable to safely exercise without trained \nsupervision.252 Therefore, a risk assessment is required for all survivors \nbefore prescribing a specific exercise program.214,253 The type of cancer, \ntreatment modalities received, and the number and severity of \ncomorbidities determine risk levels.251 Thus, disease and treatment \nhistory, late and long -term effects, and comorbidities should be assessed. \nA standardized pre-participa tion screening questionnaire, such as the \nPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone  (PAR-Q+),254 can \nalso be considered to identify patients for whom unsupervised physical \nactivity is likely safe versus those for whom it may pose undue risk.  \nSurvivors with peripheral neuropathy, poor bone health, a rthritis , or \nmusculoskeletal issues  are considered to be at moderate risk for exercise -\ninduced adverse events. Stability , balance,  and gait should be assessed in \nsurvivors with peripheral neuropathy and possibly in survivors with poor \nbone health before they engage  in exercise , and exercise choice should \nbe made based on the results (ie, stationary bike or water aerobics for \nsurvivors with poor balance).  In addition, balance training can be \nrecommended for patients at risk for  falls. Moderate -risk survivors can \noften follow the general recommendations for physical activity; however, medical clearance and/or referrals to trained personnel such as a physical \nor occupational therapist, certified exercise professional , or rehabilit ation \nspecialist can also be considered.  Specialized training in working with \nsurvivors is available for both physical therapists and exercise \nprofessionals through the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM; \nhttp://www.acsm.org/get -certified ) and the American Physical Therapy \nAssociation (APTA) Oncology section ( http://oncologypt.org/ ). Survivors \nshould be encouraged to use an ACSM - or APTA -certified trainer when \navailable.  \nLymphedema is not a contraindication for physical activity, and no special \nprecautions are required for cardiovascular/aerobic exercise or strength \ntraining of unaffec ted limbs  (see Survivor Lymphedema Education, \nbelow ).255-260 Progressive resistance training under supervision is \nrecommended as part of treatment for survivors with lymphedema (see \nTreatment  of Lymphedema, above).  \nSurvivors at high risk for exercise -assoc iated adverse events include \nthose with a history of lung surgery or major abdominal surgery, an \nostomy, cardiopulmonary comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease [COPD], congestive heart failure [ CHF], coronary artery disease \n[CAD ], cardiom yopathy), ataxia, s evere nutritional deficiencies , severe \nfatigue, or worsening/changing physical condition (eg, lymphedema \nexacerbation).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77906753-0967-4455-91a9-4f7b5745d01f": {"__data__": {"id_": "77906753-0967-4455-91a9-4f7b5745d01f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cb3c12e-4155-4cb4-a8e5-cede89adb907", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "b9609bbdc0906f48a705c0728b086cf69faa68dd7f5f48226f56881cc62ea3f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "adfd416d-d2fa-47bf-bfe0-ecfadf49ec73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "c3a134ea393878f626dcb4bca900eb2f6c7a234e70c84a0bbc2fc3a16612224d"}}, "hash": "4c2d818b1a6958d1975b46316265d0e4aaa61b7015d3c90fa3e9a32e5b7c9ae0", "text": "These survivors should receive medical evaluation and \nclearance prior to initiation of an exercise program and referr al to trained \npersonnel for a supervised exercise program.251 In general, exercise \nshould be individualized to the participant based on current exercise level \nand medical factors and should be increased in terms of intensity, \nduration, and frequency as t olerated.  \nPhysical Activity Recommendations for Survivors  \nBoth the ACS and the ACSM have made physical activity \nrecommendations for cancer survivors.212,261 In addition, the panel also", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd5284a9-dcc9-4e15-bedf-f3693306865b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd5284a9-dcc9-4e15-bedf-f3693306865b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "909ae178-1c68-4e3b-899f-a1252cbde71a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "f2f7261d3ce503f95bb6fe9e90da1c866db649c5c925dee576918a1d0fd948a7"}}, "hash": "f2f7261d3ce503f95bb6fe9e90da1c866db649c5c925dee576918a1d0fd948a7", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Nutrition and Weight Management\n\n\nSNWM-2g Many hospitals employ CSOs and those in private practice can be accessed via the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics locator at www.eatright.org.

than \nthey did in the past. They are surviving, \nand their needs have changed. \nSurvivorship care includes recovering \nfrom cancer and promoting health.\nCancer survivors\nOver the past 40 years, cancer care has greatly \nimproved. Cancer screening is finding cancer \nat early stages when it can be fully removed. \nNewer treatments are more precise and better \nat stopping cancer growth.\nWith better cancer care, people with cancer \nare living longer. As a result, the needs of the \ncancer community have changed. More people \nneed help to recover from cancer and its \ntreatment and to be healthy. \nThe term \u201ccancer survivor\u201d was proposed in \nthe 1980s. The intent of the term was to raise \nawareness of better outcomes and changing \nneeds. A person with cancer is a survivor:\n \u0086starting at the time of diagnosis,\n \u0086during and right after treatment, and\n \u0086through the balance of their life.\nSome people do not like or identify with the \nterm survivor. It is not meant to be a label. Its \npurpose is to identify the community of people \nwith a history of cancer. Having a common term \nis useful for improving the care of survivors.Survivorship care\nThe large and rising number of cancer survivors \nneed survivorship care. Survivorship care \nimproves health, wellness, and quality of life. \nStandards of survivorship care are listed in \nGuide 1 . \nPrevention\nPrevention of a new or recurring cancer is a key \npart of survivorship care. You can reduce your \nrisk of cancer with healthy living.

These guidelines are focused on options to \nmaintain and enhan ce wellness in cancer survivors who are receiving or \nhave completed active therapy, including  those receiving treatment for \nyears, those who may be in remission, and those who are cured. These \nguidelines are designed to provide a framework for the manageme nt of \nlong-term and/or late effects of cancer and its treatment. T he guidelines \nfocus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment \nof cancer can have on the adult survivor's  health,  physical and mental  \nstates, health behaviors, professional and personal identity, sexuality , and \nfinancial standing . \nThe panel acknowledges  that there is a growing population of cancer \nsurvivors with chronic cancer. This group includes those with incurable \ndisease who are receiving  systemic therapy  continuously  and those  who \nmay be  on treatment  intermittently. Although these guidelines do not \naddress the specific needs of survivors with chronic cancer (eg, \npsychosocial issues related to living for years with a terminal diagnosis \nand u ncertainty about the future; how to handle comorbid conditions and \ndisease prevention, screening, and treatment in the setting of limited life \nexpectancy; managing discussions around new drugs and early -stage \nclinical trials ),15 many of the recommendations in these guidelines are relevant to this population (eg, those around fatigue, anxiety, depression ). \nThe panel emphasizes that these guidelines may be used to guide the \nmanagement of all cancer survivors \u2013 not just those who have completed \ntreatment, but also the population with chronic cancer.  \nThese guidelines  should be used as a supplement to the follow -up \nrecommendations within the disease -specific guidelines (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site, available at www.NCCN.org ) \nand should provide a framework for the coordination of care between the \nsurvivor\u2019s health care providers to ensure that needs are appropriately \naddressed.  \nThese guidelines are not intended to provide guidance for the care of \nsurvivors of childhood cancer (detailed guidelines for the care of childhood \ncancer survivors are available from the Children\u2019s Oncology Group at \nhttp://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/ ). For survivorship issues related to \nyounger populations,  please also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent \nand Young Adult  (AYA) Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org ). For \nsurvivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune -\nmediated toxicities is warranted (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nManagement of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nFor this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Surv ivorship, the panel \nfocused on the preventive health issues including healthy lifestyle \nbehaviors, immunizations and prevention of infection, and cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD) risk assessment and modification . The panel also focused \non several common issues  of survivors: 1) anthracycline -induced cardiac \ntoxicity; 2) anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress; 3) cognitive decline; \n4) fatigue; 5) lymphedema; 6) hormone -related symptoms; 7) pain; 8) \nfemale and male sexual dysfunction;  and 9)  sleep disorders.

Counseling regarding cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle modifications are \nparamount in cancer survivors and patients with favorable prognoses. The risk of CVD-related death varies with years from diagnosis, with \nmost survivors being at greatest risk 5 or more years after diagnosis and completion of curative therapy.\n\u2022 Referral to a cardiologist or cardio-oncologist in patients at elevated CVD risk should be considered at any stage of the cancer journey .\n\u2022 Shared risk factors for both cancer and CVD (ie, smoking, poor health behaviors) contribute to the development of CVD and structural heart \ndisease or heart failure, a concept that becomes especially relevant to cancer survivors. Attention and counseling regarding shared risk \nfactors may improve cancer- and cardiovascular-related outcomes.\n\u2022 Cancer treatments (immunotherapy,a cytotoxic and targeted systemic therapies,b RT) can result in diverse cardiovascular issues, including \ncardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis after head and neck and mantle \nradiation, and cerebrovascular accidents.\n\u0017Survivors treated with anthracyclines are at increased risk for heart failure (SCARDIO-1).\n\u0017Androgen or estrogen deprivation therapy may elevate cardiovascular risk.c\n\u2022 Most CVDs (such as atherosclerosis) develop over time as a result of well-defined risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, use of \ntobacco products, obesity, and diabetes. Control of these risk factors can decrease the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. \n\u2022 Survivors should be assessed throughout the survivorship continuum for:\n\u0017Pre-existing and emerging CVD (eg, CAD, CHF, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation) and CVD risk factors \n(eg, hypertension, dislipidemia, obesity, cigarette/tobacco use, diabetes mellitus), with intervention for modifiable risk factors as necessary\n\u0017Cancer treatment history (eg, regimen/dose,b radiation field, dose/volume)\n\u0017Diet and exercise habits\n\u2022 Tools exist to help quantify atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk (eg, ASCVD risk scored).\n\u2022 Survivors should be counseled on any increased risk of CVD they may have based on prior treatment, comorbidity, or CVD risk factors and \non the ABCDEs of CVD Prevention (see Table 1 on SCVD-2).\n\u2022 Cooperation and shared care with primary care providers, and cardiovascular specialists as needed, is key to optimizing cardiac and \nvascular outcomes in cancer survivors. \n\u2022 Consider referral to cardio-oncology or a cardiology specialist for high-risk survivors.e\na Drobni ZD, Alvi RM, Taron J, et al.

See \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site and NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care for recommendations regarding metastatic disease. \n\u2022 These guidelines, with the appropriate disease-specific guideline, provide a framework for the coordination of care between the survivor's health care \nproviders to ensure that needs are appropriately addressed.\n\u2022 The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be addressed at every visit. The panel recommends periodic screening assessments and \nappropriate follow-up care as clinically indicated. \n\u2022 Referral to other health care disciplines/providers or community resources may be used to address several indications or identified issues with one \nintervention (eg, rehabilitation for fatigue, depression, and pain).\n\u2022 The panel recommends stakeholders ensure the implementation of guideline-concordant survivorship care within their unique health \nsystems.1  Specifically, institutions are encouraged to determine how to systematically deliver the six key components of survivorship care \n(SURV-1).1-3 There are several models of care that frame the implementation of survivorship care according to provider type(s), clinic type(s), \npatient risk, and other factors.4-7 Engaging these models of care will facilitate implementation planning.7 Panel members recommend \ninstitutions provide the resources necessary to plan, deliver, and evaluate their survivorship care program(s).1-2\n\u2022 For survivorship issues related to younger populations, also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and the \nChildren's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers  \n(www.survivorshipguidelines.org).\n\u2022 For survivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune-mediated toxicities is warranted.

A \nlarger waist circumference increases risk for diabetes, hypertension, and \nCVD .324 \nCurrent dietary and physical act ivity habits and potential barriers to \nphysical activity or a healthful diet of those in high -risk groups should be \nascertained either by the oncologist or other appropriate allied health \npersonnel (eg, nurses, dietitians). In addition, effects of cancer t reatment \nand other medical issues, including psychosocial distress and fear of \nrecurrence, should be assessed and addressed as necessary.  \nWeight Management for Survivors  \nProviders should discuss strategies to prevent weight gain for normal and \noverweight/o bese survivors . Clinicians should reinforce the importance of \nmaintaining a  normal body weight throughout life and encourage  all cancer \nsurvivors  to achieve and maintain a normal BMI and strive for metabolic \nhealth . In conjunction with primary care, surviv ors should be assessed for \nmetabolic health, body composition, and BMI. Regardless of BMI, all \nsurvivors should be advised about the panel\u2019s nutrition, weight \nmanagement, and physical activity recommendations (see pages SNWM -\n1, SNWM -2, and SPA -1 in the algorithm, above ).

Recommen dations for Normal Weight Survivors  \nIn addition to discussing nutrition, weight management, and physical \nactivity, clinicians should reinforce the importance of maintaining a normal \nweight throughout life in survivors with a BMI in the normal range. In \nparticular, the importance of avoiding high -calorie, low -nutrient foods (eg, \nregular soft drinks, sugary desserts, fried foods) and focusing on lower -\ncalorie, high -nutrient foods (eg, vegetables [especially those lower in \nstarch], broth -based soups, fresh fruit for desserts, and beverages such as \nwater, unsweetened tea, and black coffee) is especially important.  \nRecommendations for Overweight/Obese Survivors  \nSurvivors with a BMI in the overweight or obese range should be engaged \nin discussions about nutriti on, weight management, and physical activity, \nas outlined in these guidelines. In addition, clinicians should specifically \ndiscuss portion control; substituting  high-calorie foods  with low-calorie, \nhealthful, nutrient -dense  foods; and tracking diet, calori es, and  physical \nactivity. Clinicians should also refer overweight/obese survivors to a PCP \nor appropriate hospital -based or community resources.

However, discussions about work are ideally best had before treatment begins so that treatment recommendations \ncan take work needs into consideration if possible. \n\u2022 Symptoms affecting work may wax and wane with a survivor\u2019s treatments or disease status, especially if they are living chronically with \ncancer or the consequences of cancer treatment. Some survivors might start and stop working more than once.\n\u2022 Most existing literature focuses on unemployment and/or those who do not return to work. However, underemployment and/or work \nlimitations due to cancer or side effects are also common.\n\u2022 Employment helps to protect survivors from financial toxicity and, at least in the United States, is frequently tied to health insurance access. \nThis can be a main reason survivors work even when/if they are not fully recovered.\n\u2022 Employment is an important source of personal interaction, normalcy , and social support. The psychosocial effects/advantages derived from \nwork may include a sense of purpose, emotional well-being, link to identity , improved quality of life, connection with others, and distraction.\n\u2022 Some populations are at increased risk for difficulties related to work (based on factors such as gender , age, race, ethnicity, cancer type, \ncancer stage, rural residence, educational attainment, etc). The increased difficulties in these populations are more likely for survivors \nwith physically or cognitively demanding jobs or jobs with limited flexibility in scheduling or tasks. Additionally, patients with cancer may \nexperience discrimination as a result of diagnosis/illness, and this may be a consideration for some individuals in decisions surrounding \nemployment.\n\u2022 Survivors should be offered information to help them understand their likely ability to work, take into account their finances and personal/\nfamily needs, and discuss potential work accommodations with their employers.1 \n\u2022 Clinicians should regularly re-evaluate work-related concerns post active cancer treatment or for persons living chronically with cancer .\n\u0017Periodically identify goals and barriers regarding work with survivor  (SWORK-3).\n\u0017A team approach may be needed. Consider early involvement of social work, primary care, physical therapy/occupational therapy, cancer \nrehabilitation, and/or career counseling services, if available.\n\u0017Employment disability forms are not typically well-suited to cancer .

The assessment should include : 1) \npre-existing and emerging CVD including CAD , CHF, peripheral vascular \ndisease, and arrhythmias including atria l fibrillation; 2) CVD risk factors \nincluding hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, cigarette/tobacco use, and \ndiabetes mellitus; 3) cancer treatment history including systemic therapy \nregimen and radiation field, including cumulative doses received of \napplicable cardiotoxic therapies; and 4) diet and exercise habits and \ncigarette/tobacco use. The counseling should include discussions of any \nincreased risk of CVD the survivor may have based on prior cancer \ntreatment, comorbidity, or CVD risk factors and on t he ABCDE's of CVD \nPrevention . Interventions for modifiable risk factors should be \nrecommended as appropriate. Cooperation and shared care with primary \ncare providers, and with cardiovascular specialists as needed, is key to \noptimizing cardiac and vascular outcomes in cancer survivors.

In addition, a pilot study asses sed the use of electronic \nhealth records (EHRs) to reduce the time and effort involved with creating \ncare plans.165 Although many plan elements required manual entry by the \noncologist, the median time to complete the plans was only 3 minutes \n(range 2 \u201312 minutes ). Another group reported on a similar initiative to \nfacilitate genera tion of care plans using EHRs.166 Care plan creation took a \nmean 12 minutes (range 10 \u201315 minutes). However, a study in which EHR -\nbased treatment summaries were abstracted and cross -checked revealed \nthat 30% contained \u22651 omissions , and 10% contained \u22651 errors, indicating \nthat autopopulatio n systems will require manual double -checking to \nensure accuracy.167 Thus, providing a survivorship care plan is time -\nconsuming and resource -intensive and could have unforeseen \nharms.154,168 \nBecause definitive evidence that survivorship care plans improve \noutcomes is lacking, the NCCN Survivo rship Panel currently recommends \nplanning for ongoing survivorship care, but does not mandate the use of \nsurvivorship care  plans . The plan ning should include:  \n\u2022 Information on treatment received including all surgeries, radiation \ntherapy, and systemic therap ies \n\u2022 Information regarding follow -up care , surveillance, and screening \nrecommendations  \u2022 Information on post -treatment needs, including information \nregarding acute, late and long -term treatment -related effects , and \nhealth risks when possible (See NCCN Guidelines  for Treatment of \nCancer by Site ) \n\u2022 Delineation regarding roles of oncologists, PCP s, and subspecialty \ncare physicians in long-term care and timing of transfer of care if \nappropriate  \n\u2022 Healthy behavior recommendations  \n\u2022 Periodic  assessment of ongoing needs and identification of \nappropriate resources  \nData from o ngoing trials will help inform future recommendations . \nSurveillance fo r Cancer Recurrence  \nScreening for cancer recurrence is an important aspect of survivorship \ncare. In general, this surveillance is performed by the oncology team. \nWhen surveillance is overseen by the primary care team, the oncologist \nshould provide evidence -based recommendations based on currently \navailable guidelines. Specific recommendations for surveillance testing \nvary between cancer site and stage and individualized patient risk and are \nnot addressed in these guidelines. Please see individual NCCN Guide lines \nfor Treatment of Cancer by Site (available online at www.NCCN.org ) for \ndisease -specific surveillance recommendations. Additional lab work, \nimaging studies, or other studies to eval uate for recurrence should be \nbased on clinical presentation and judgment. The use of radiologic \nimaging studies (ie, CT) should be based on evidence that early detection \nof recurrence will improve cancer -related outcomes, because evidence \nsuggests that ex cess radiation exposure associated with CT imaging may \nbe associated with an increased risk of developing a radiation -associated \ncancer.169,170", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

randomized \ncontrolled trials have assessed the role of various vitamins or other dietary \nsupplements for the purposes of prim ary cancer prevention, cancer \ncontrol, or preventing cancer recurrence.363-377 No clear evidence supp orts \nan effect of dietary  suppleme nts for cancer prevention , control, or \nrecurrence, although a few exceptions may warrant further studies.378,379 In \nfact, a prospective cohort study of 2118 postmenopausal  cancer survivors \nfound that post-diagnosis dietary supplement use  was associated with a \ntrend towards higher mortality among those with a poor diet .380  \nAlthough the FDA regulates dietary supplement products  under the \nDietary Suppleme nt He alth and Education Act of 1994 ( DSHEA ),381 \nanalyses of dietary supplements from multiple manufacturers have found \nthat many products do not contain the purported active ingredient and can \ncontain unlisted ingredients such as cheap fillers (eg, rice, house plants) \nor banned pharma ceutical ingredients .382,383 Furthermore, dietary \nsupplements may remain available to consumers even following FDA \nclass I drug recalls .382  \nDespite the lack of data supporting supplement use and the lack of \nassurance regarding supplement quality, as many as 70% to 85% of \nsurvivors take some vitamin or mineral dietary supplements, often without \ndisclosing this information to their physicians.380,38 4-386 Thus, the panel \nrecommends that providers ask survivors about supplement use at reg ular \nintervals.   \nThe panel notes that supplement use is not recommended for most \nsurvivors, except in instances of documented deficiencies (eg, survivors of \ngastric cancer), inadequate diet, or comorbid indications (eg, \nosteoporosis,387 ophthalmologic

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and \nserotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can therefore be \nused in s urvivors with moderate - to severe -intensity major depr ession, \ngeneralized anxiety, panic , or PTSD . SNRIs should be considered for \nconcomitant pain or concomitant hot flashes (also see Hormone -Related \nSymptoms ). Psychotropics with cytochrome P450 interactions (ie, \nfluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion,  fluvoxamine , nefazodone , \nduloxetine, clomipramine ) should be used with caution in survivors taking \ntamoxifen. Pure SSRIs, and in particular paroxetine, block conversion of \ntamoxifen to active metabolites through CYP2D6 and should be used with \ncaution for patients  on tamoxifen (see Hormone -Related Symptoms  for a \ndiscussion of psychotropics and cytochrome P450 interactions).579-581 Survivors should be counseled that it may take up to 2 to 6 weeks at a \nthera peutic dose for SSRIs and SNRIs to take effect, and that a trial of \nseveral different drugs may be needed to find the best option for an \nindividual. BZDs (ie, clonazepam, lorazepam) can be used for acute \nanxiety relief or while waiting for antidepressants to take effect. The BZD \ndose should be adjusted once SSRIs or SNRIs are fully effective and \nsymptoms are partially or completely abated. Survivors should also be \ncounseled that symptoms of withdrawal may occur should any of the \nabove -mentioned medications be abruptly discontinued.  Referral to a \nmental health professional should be considered if the response to first -\nline treatment  is inadequate.  \nCognitive Dysfunction  \nCognitive impairment is a common complaint among cancer survivors and \nmay be a consequence of the tumors themselves or of the direct effects of \ncancer -related treatment (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy). This \nsymptom may be especially prominent in survivors of primary central \nnervous system (CNS) cancers or those with brain metas tases, but \nsurvivors who never had brain involvement may also report difficulties in \ncognition.582 For some survivors, symptoms persist long -term.583 When \nsevere, the presence of cognitive dysfunction can impact quali ty of life and \nfunction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ede6dd1-9aa3-4616-9aa4-62298a9973af": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ede6dd1-9aa3-4616-9aa4-62298a9973af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "016dcd53-0559-4e01-beaf-149dd51aa9d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "6133a0539d81da3fea05088ca306ee13b959744b08fe0dd143f9b607aee9e91f"}}, "hash": "6133a0539d81da3fea05088ca306ee13b959744b08fe0dd143f9b607aee9e91f", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-38 sections.

Practical suggestions include instruction \nin self -management and coping strategies (eg, using planners, reminder \nnotes, and/or smart phone technology; keeping items in the same place), \nwhich the panel believes can be very helpful to patients. Discontinuation or \nlimitation of use of medications known to cause or contribute to cognitive \nimpairment should be attempted. Management of depression/emotional \ndistress, pain, sleep disturbances, and fatigue should be provided. In fact, \na study showed that CBT for fatigue was e ffective at reducing self -\nreported cognitive disability and concentration problems in 98 severely \nfatigued cancer survivors  randomized to CBT compared with those \nrandomized to a wait list.635 However, no difference in neuropsychological \ntest performance  was observed.  \nCBT for cognitive dysfunction may also help some survivors. In one small \nstudy, CBT was evaluated in 40 breast cancer survivors using a waitlist \ncontrol trial design.636 Although overall quality of life improved with the \nintervention, statistically significant improvement was noted only with \nverbal memory, not with self -reports of daily cognitive complaints. Ano ther \nstudy of CBT delivered by video conference in 47 survivors of breast \ncancer found that CBT led to improvements in self-reported  cognitive \nimpairment  and in neuropsychological processing speed  compared with \nsupportive therapy.637 \nRoutine physical activity should be encouraged. Substantial evidence \nshows that physical activity enhances cognitive function in elderly people \nin general, although only few studies specific to cancer survivors have been repor ted.638-642 A small randomized controlled trial  of an exercise \nintervention versus control in breast cancer survivors evaluated objective \nand self -reported cognition.642 The exercise intervention significantly \nimproved processing speed among those who had been diagnosed within \nthe past 2 years , but no other significant differences were observed . \nCognitive training (ie, brain games)  can also be considered. Cognitive \ntraining has demonstrated benefits in self -reported and objectively \nassessed cognitive function, including memory, executive function, and \nverbal function .639,643 One study randomized 157 breast cancer survivors \nto web-based cognitive training with telephone support or to wait-list \ncontrol .644 Verbal learning and results on a working memory test showed \nstatistically significant improvement in the cognitive training group, but no \nimprovements were seen for an objective measure of working memory \nand a measure of perceived cognitive functioning . Another study used a 5 -\nsession, small -group intervention of psychoeducation and cognitive \nexercises  in 48 breast cancer survivors.645 Compared to survivors \nrandomized to a wait -list control group, survivors in the intervention arm \nexperienced i mprovements in self -reported cognit ive complaints and \nmemory functioning on neurocognitive testing . A larger study of 242 \nsurvivors with self -reported , persistent cognitive symptoms  after \nchemotherapy for non -CNS cancers found that survivors randomized to a \nweb-based cognitive training prog ram had statistically significant \nimprovements in perceived cognitive impairment  immediately and 6 \nmonths after the intervention.646 Improvements in anxiety, depression, \nfatigue, and stress were also seen after the intervention, which used \nadaptive exercises that targeted cognitive domains, such as visual \nprecision, working memory, and visual processing speed.  \nRelaxation, stress manage ment,  meditation, and yoga can also be \nconsidered.

Several studies have shown that unemployment rates for \nsurvivors are higher than for the general population.87-90 Furthermore, \nthose survivors who do return to work often encounter difficulties, such as \nphysical or c ognitive limitations, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and \nperceived or real discrimination.87,91,92 \nSeveral studies  have addressed factors that predict a delayed return to \nwork.93-99 For example, a French p opulation -based study revealed that \nclinical factors, such as severity of the cancer, receipt of chemotherapy , or \nthe experience of adverse effec ts, were associated with a delay in return \nto work.97 In addition, a systematic review of cohort studies found that \nsurvivors who were o lder, had a lower educa tion level, or had a  lower \nincome  were less likely to return to work.98 Another systematic review \nidentified factors related to the person ( eg, symptoms, coping, motivation), \nenvironmental supports ( eg, family, workplace), and occupation ( eg, type \nof work, job flexibility)  that impacted successful return to work after cancer \ntreatment.100 \nSome interventions to enhance return -to-work in cancer survivors have \nbeen studied (eg, psycho -education , physical training, vocational \ncounseling ), although additional research in this area is greatly needed .101-\n104 Multidisciplinary interventions that combine vocational counseling with \nother elements (eg,  patient education, patient counseling, behavioral \ntraining , physical exercises ) may increase rates of  return -to-work \ncompared to usual care.

There are many types of survivors, including those living with cancer \nand those fr ee of cancer. This term is meant to capture a population of \nthose with a history of cancer rather than to provide a label that ma y or \nmay not resonate with individuals .\u201d16  \nThe Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment  \nFor some survivors, the consequences of cancer are minimal; these \npatients can return to a normal life after the completion of treatment. In \nfact, most cancer survivors rep ort being in good general health and \nexperience good to excellent quality of life.17,18 Also, a survey of 659 \nsurvivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers  found that a majority \ndo not suffer from psychologic morbidity or have a large number of unmet \nsupportive care need s.19,20 Other studies have similarly found that most \nsurvivors enjoy a high quality of life without a large number of cancer -\nrelated symptoms.21,22 \nHowever, many survivors do experience physical and/or psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment.23-25 Some sequelae become evident \nduring anticancer treatment (long -term effects), whereas others may not \nmanifest for months or years after active therapy (late effects).  The \nproblems can range from mild to severe,  debilitating, or even life -\nthreatening. Some problems are temporary or improve with time, whereas \nother problems are progressive or permanent. This topic has been well \nreviewed.18,26 \nA literature review suggests that at least 50% of survivors experience \nsome late effect s of cancer treatment.26 The most common problems in \ncancer survivors are depression , pain, and fat igue.27 The exact prevalence of various effects of cancer and its treatment are hard to quantify, because \nfew studies have addressed these issues in a longitudinal fashion, \ncomparing patients with and without a histo ry of cancer to differentiate \nbetween the effects of cancer and the effects of aging.18 In general, the \nprevalence of late effects in cancer survivo rs is believed to have increased \nover time, likely because anticancer interventions have become more \ncomplex and intense with combinations of surgery, radiation, \nchemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted biologics.28 \nPhysical Effects  \nPhysical effects of cancer and its treatment in cancer survivors include \npain, muscu loskeletal issues, fatigue, lack of stamina, urinary and bowel \nproblems , lymphedema , premature menopause, cognitive deficits, \ndiabetes, and sexual dysfunction.18,29 -32 The effects of cancer treatment on \nthe heart and bone

Planning for ongoing survivorship care (see below)  \nIn addition, the IOM report d iscusses the importance of policies that \nensure access to and health insurance coverage for all aspects of \nsurvivorship care, including psychosocial services.  Cancer survivors with \nuntreated distress have poorer compliance with surveillance screenings \nand are less likely to exercise and quit smoking.120 A 2008 IOM report, \n\u201cCancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health \nNeeds, \u201d121 concluded that psychosocial screening and care should be a \npart of the new standard for quality cancer care and should be integrated \ninto routine care across the trajectory of cancer, which inc ludes the period \nafter active treatment . See the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management \n(available at www.NCCN.org ) and Anxiety and Depression  below for \nrecommendations on screening for and treating distress.  \nIn September  2011, the LIVESTRONG Foundation convened a meeting of \nexperts and stakeholders in the survivorshi p field to define essential elements of survivorship care.  After 2 days of consensus building, the \ngroup agreed on the following elements that all medical settings must \nprovide for cancer survivors, either directly or through referral \n(http://images.livestrong.org/downloads/flatfiles/what -we-do/our -\napproach/reports/ee/EssentialElementsBrief.pdf ): \n1. Survivorship care plan, psychosocial care plan, and treatment \nsummary  \n2. Screening for new cancers and surveillance for recurrence  \n3. Care coordination strategy that addresses care coordination with \nPCPs and primary oncologists  \n4. Health promotion education  \n5. Symptom m anagement and palliative care  \nThe 2020 Commission on Cancer (CoC) of the American College of \nSurgeons \u2019 accreditation standards for hospital cancer programs  \n(https://www.facs.org/ quality -programs/cancer/coc/standards/2020 ) has a \npatient -centered focus that recommends and encourages, but does not \nrequire, the development and dissemination of a survivorship care plan for \nall patients completing prim ary therapy.  The current standard requires the \ndevelopment and implementation of a survivorship program directed at \nmeeting the ongoing needs of survivors treated with curative intent. More \ninformation can be found on its website.  \nImplementation of these standards for survivorship care has been \nchallenging, and reasons for the difficulties have b een described.122-124 To \nmove toward the goal of personalized pathways to ensure that all cancer \nsurvivors receive all essential components of care, an ACS -ASCO summit \nidentified the following necessary strategies: 1) developing  candidate care \ndelivery model s; 2) conducting implementation studies to model the effects \nof personalized follow -up care pathways on survivor  outcomes, workforce \nand health care resources, and utilization and costs; 3) developing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a2ccd23-96d9-4662-b92d-c541ea55392c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a2ccd23-96d9-4662-b92d-c541ea55392c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "31ca7ddd-6a1d-4b07-8f41-5efa3b2e6845", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "5f4de17591763cd828449f34e8d8072a51467875f54561f5d2631dbfb8b84811"}}, "hash": "5f4de17591763cd828449f34e8d8072a51467875f54561f5d2631dbfb8b84811", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-37 The underlying mechanisms that might increase the risk for cancer -related \ncognitive changes are n ot known. Studies have reported elevated levels of \ncytokines or DNA damage as some of the possible mechanisms.622 \nStructural studies have supported the hypothesis that neurotoxicity \nresulting in damage to white matter of the brain may play an important role \nin cognitive deficits after chemotherapy treatment,583,586,599,623,624 and \nfunctional MRI studies show that changes in brain activity accompany \ncognitive complaints or cognitive deficits in survivors.624-626 In addition, \ninsomnia, fatigue, and depression, common in cancer survivors, may \nnegatively influence cognitive function, although several studies have \nfound that cognitive dysfunction does not correlate with mood.616,627,628 \nPsychosomati c effects can also contribute, as evidenced by a study of \npatients to be treated with chemotherapy that found that those who were \ninformed of the possible cognitive side effects were more likely to report \ncognitive dysfunction and perform worse on neuropsy chological testing \nthan uninformed patients.629 A better und erstanding of the mechanisms \nthat cause cancer -related cognitive impairment is essential for the \ndevelopment of treatments to improve cognitive function and quality of life \nin patients with cancer and survivors.582,630,631 \nIn October 2006, the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force \n(ICCTF)  was formed, comprising a multidisciplinary group of health \nprofessionals and health advocates. The mission of ICCTF is to advance \nunderstanding of the impact of cancer and cancer -related treatment on \ncognitive and behavioral functioning in patients with C NS and non -CNS \ncancers.632 The group published recommendations regarding \nneuropsychological testing, defining cognitive impairment /changes, \nneuroimaging, and future study design.631,633 \nThese NCCN Guidelines address cognitive function of survivors with non -\nCNS malignancies who did not have CNS -directed therapies.  Assessment and Evaluation for Cognitive Dysfunction  \nPatients who report cognitive impairment should be screened for \npotentially reversible factors that may contribute to cognitive impairment, \nincluding depression, pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Some  \nmedications can also contribute to cognitive impairment. Therefore, \ncurrent medications, including over -the-counter medications and \nsupplements, should be reviewed.  \nFor those who present with concomitant focal neurologic deficits and those \nwhose symptoms  evolve to include these findings, imaging is indicated to \nrule out structural abnormalities  (ie, brain or CNS disease). In addition, \nimaging in the absence of focal findings may be appropriate for patients \ndeemed to be at high risk for recurrence or metas tatic disease involving \nthe CNS.  \nUnfortunately, no effective brief screening tool for cancer -associated \ncognitive dysfunction in the asymptomatic cancer survivor currently exists. \nThe Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE634) and similar screening tools \nlack adequate sensitivity  to detect the subtle decline in cognitive \nperformance seen in most cancer survivors. Instead, the panel listed \nseveral questions that can help clarify the nature of the impairment, \nincluding inquiries about the ability to pay attention, find words, rememb er \nthings, think clearly, and perform functions. The time of onset of symptoms \nand the trajectory over time should also be assessed.  \nManagement of Cognitive Dysfunction  \nSurvivors benefit from validation of their symptom experience and should \nbe reassured t hat, in most survivors, cognitive dysfunction does not \nworsen over time. In fact, data from breast cancer survivors suggest that \nsymptoms may improve over time.585 The panel recommends the use of \nnonpharmacologic interventions whenever possible, with pharmacologic \ninterventions as a last line of therapy in survivors for whom other \ninterventions have been insufficient, as discussed in the following", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02995427-6a57-4f0c-83fa-0126b67e01b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "02995427-6a57-4f0c-83fa-0126b67e01b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f600687-87ea-4d91-b7b0-4b7fdb91f451", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "a9daefae47a27da7ab5b1d087f7c64c73835e6d40a3d93f06c5ad182bfeb4bbd"}}, "hash": "a9daefae47a27da7ab5b1d087f7c64c73835e6d40a3d93f06c5ad182bfeb4bbd", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Physical Activity\n\n\nSPA-B\n1 OF 2a From the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/obesity/lose_wt/phy_act.htm)  and the Compendium of Physical \nActivities (https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities) .\nb Reproduced and adapted from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
