If detected \nearly, treatment for a late effect may reduce its \nimpact on your life.\nCancer surveillance\nCancer that was thought to be cured can \nreappear on tests. The return of cancer is \ncalled a recurrence or relapse. Survivorship \ncare includes routine checking for a recurrence. \nThis is called surveillance. Surveillance often \nincludes updating your health history and a \nphysical exam. Some survivors get blood tests \nor imaging like x-rays or scans.\nScreening for cancer\nCancer screening is routine testing of cancer \nor pre-cancer conditions. The aim is to detect \ncancer at an early stage when treatment works \nbest. There is screening for prostate, breast, \ncervical, skin, lung, and colorectal cancers. \nScreening is started when there is an average \nor high risk of cancer. Ask your health care \nprovider what screening, if any, you need.\nSurvivors have a higher risk of a new (second) \ncancer. Ask your health care provider about \nyour chance of getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some causes of a first cancer may be \nrelated to getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some cancer treatments may increase \ncancer risk. Such treatments include \nradiation therapy, certain chemotherapies, \nand certain targeted therapies. \u0086Excess radiation from a lifetime of \ncomputed tomography (CT) scans slightly \nincreases cancer risk. Ask your provider if \nthese scans are needed and for how long.\nSome survivors are at risk of hereditary \ncancers. Hereditary cancer is caused by \nabnormal genes that are passed down from \nparents to children. Cancers that can be \nhereditary include breast, ovarian, colorectal, \nand prostate cancer.\nAt health visits, update your health care \nproviders on any new cancers among your \nblood relatives. Your provider may suggest \ngetting genetic testing. A blood sample is \nneeded. You may talk with a genetic counselor \nto discuss your family\u2019s cancer history.\nLate effects\nMany effects of treatment quickly resolve \nafter treatment ends. An example is nausea \nand vomiting. Long-term effects start during \ntreatment and persist after treatment is done. \nLess often, effects start long after treatment \nhas ended. During health visits, your health \ncare providers will assess for such late effects. \nThey will provide treatment for late or long-term \neffects as needed.\nCoordinated care\nCancer survivors often receive care from \nmultiple providers. You may receive care from \noncologists, a primary care provider, and non-\ncancer specialists. Your providers will work \ntogether and clarify their roles to address all \nyour needs.

This increased risk is due to genetic susceptibilities (eg, \nhereditary cancer syndromes) and/or family history, shared etiologic exposures (eg, smoking, environmental exposures, health behaviors, \nhuman papillomavirus [HPV]), and mutagenic effects of cancer treatment. Health behaviors should be modified as possible (eg, smoking \ncessation, weight management) to decrease the risk of subsequent malignancies.\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyle and behavioral counseling are important to reduce risk factors that may contribute to subsequent cancers (HL-1).\n\u2022 Treatment-related subsequent primary cancers vary with the type and intensity of anticancer treatment and are associated in particular with \nRT and specific chemotherapeutic agents. For recommendations for screening considerations, s ee Principles of Screening for Treatment-\nRelated Subsequent Primary Cancers (SURV-C).\n\u2022 Screening for subsequent primary cancers should be a shared responsibility between primary and oncology care physicians.

In addition, a pilot study asses sed the use of electronic \nhealth records (EHRs) to reduce the time and effort involved with creating \ncare plans.165 Although many plan elements required manual entry by the \noncologist, the median time to complete the plans was only 3 minutes \n(range 2 \u201312 minutes ). Another group reported on a similar initiative to \nfacilitate genera tion of care plans using EHRs.166 Care plan creation took a \nmean 12 minutes (range 10 \u201315 minutes).

In addition, research focused \non patterns and quality of survivorship care  is lacking. A study of NIH \nsurvivorship grants in fiscal year 2016 showed a need for research \nincluding more diverse cancer types, older and longer -term survivors, and \nmore ethnoculturally diverse populations of survivors.181 \nIn June 2012, the ACS , CDC, LIVE STRONG  Foundation , and NCI held a \njoint meeting and created an action plan to facilitate the translation of \nsurvivorship research into survivorship care.182 The plan is driven by \ncollaboration between researchers, survivors, clinicians, and public health \nprofessionals; the use of technology, such as EHRs; analysis of \ninformation from the vie wpoints of multiple stakeholders; and the \nintegration and synthesis of knowledge using systematic reviews and \nmeta -analyses.  Recommendations for Preventive Health  \nAnalysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  \n(BRFSS)  indicates that a  large proportion of cancer survivors have \nsignificant comorbidities, smoke, are obese, and/or do not engage in \nphysical activity.183 Analysis of data from oth er studies, including the \nNational Health Interview Survey , showed similar results.184-187 Separate \nsurveys by the ACS and the CDC  found that 9.3% and 17% of survivors \nsmoke, respectively.186,188 In addition, many survivors forego \nrecommended cancer screenings (ie, co lorectal and cervical screening) \nand follow -up surveillance189-191 or demand more intense surveillance than \nevidence sup ports.84 \nHealthy Lifestyles  \nHealthy lifestyle habits, such as enga ging in routine physical activity, \nmaintaining a healthy diet and weight, and avoiding cigarette/ tobacco use, \nhave been associated with improved health outcomes and quality of life. \nFor some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been associated with a reduced \nrisk of recurrence and death .192-199 In fact, the maintenance of a healthy \nlifestyle is associated with a decrease in premature death in cancer \nsurvivors.200 Therefore,  survivors should be encouraged to achieve and \nmaintain a healthy lifestyle , including  attention to weight management, \nphysical  activity, metabolic health, and dietary habits.  Setting incremental \ngoals for diet, physical activity, and weight management  should be \nadvised .

They \ncan be used to optimize health and wellness for all survivors; however, they were created to assist health care professionals who work with survivors \nof adult-onset cancer in the post-treatment period, including those in both the oncology and primary care practices. \n\u2022 The panel recognizes that many of the post-treatment issues covered in these Guidelines are best addressed before cancer treatment begins so that \nmany problems can be prevented or minimized.\n\u2022 These guidelines are designed to provide a framework for the general survivorship care and management of potential long-term and/or late effects of \ncancer and its treatment that survivors may experience.\n\u2022 The NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship should be used as a supplement to the follow-up recommendations within the disease-specific guidelines. See \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site and NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care for recommendations regarding metastatic disease. \n\u2022 These guidelines, with the appropriate disease-specific guideline, provide a framework for the coordination of care between the survivor's health care \nproviders to ensure that needs are appropriately addressed.\n\u2022 The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be addressed at every visit. The panel recommends periodic screening assessments and \nappropriate follow-up care as clinically indicated. \n\u2022 Referral to other health care disciplines/providers or community resources may be used to address several indications or identified issues with one \nintervention (eg, rehabilitation for fatigue, depression, and pain).\n\u2022 The panel recommends stakeholders ensure the implementation of guideline-concordant survivorship care within their unique health \nsystems.1  Specifically, institutions are encouraged to determine how to systematically deliver the six key components of survivorship care \n(SURV-1).1-3 There are several models of care that frame the implementation of survivorship care according to provider type(s), clinic type(s), \npatient risk, and other factors.4-7 Engaging these models of care will facilitate implementation planning.7 Panel members recommend \ninstitutions provide the resources necessary to plan, deliver, and evaluate their survivorship care program(s).1-2\n\u2022 For survivorship issues related to younger populations, also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and the \nChildren's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers  \n(www.survivorshipguidelines.org).\n\u2022 For survivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune-mediated toxicities is warranted.

It sometimes occurs after surgery. \nCancer survivors may have mild to moderate \nfatigue for months or years after diagnosis.Screening and assessment\nYour health care provider may screen for \nfatigue on a regular basis. Fatigue screening \ntools consist of a brief scale or survey. There \nis no exam or lab test for fatigue. Fatigue \nscreening helps identify people with fatigue and \nassess treatment results.\nFatigue ranges from mild to severe levels. Your \nprovider will perform an in-depth assessment \nif you have moderate or severe fatigue months \nafter initial treatment. An assessment is also \nneeded if fatigue starts or worsens after \ntreatment ends. \nYour provider will ask you questions. Be ready \nto describe when the fatigue started and \nwhether it\u2019s changed over time. Your provider \nwill also assess for causes of fatigue that can \nbe treated. Some health conditions that cause \nfatigue are listed in Guide 13 .\nYour provider will order blood tests if needed. \nA complete blood count (CBC) with differential \nmeasures parts of the blood, such as red blood \ncells. A comprehensive metabolic panel can \nshow if you have liver or kidney problems. \nLevels of hormones can be checked using a \nblood sample.\nSome people may need further testing. Your \nprovider may order imaging if you have \nconcerning symptoms. Imaging makes pictures \nof the insides of your body.

In addition, lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of \nsubsequent primary cancers (eg, smoking cessation, physical activity, \nweight loss) should be encouraged.64 Finally, referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates, such as those with a cancer diagnosis at a young age or with \nmultiple primary cancers , to identify those with a potential increased risk  \nfor subsequent malignancies.65 Family cancer history should be \nperiodically updated to reassess hereditary risk, because it should not be \nassumed that all cancer survivors were assessed at diagnosis. Gen etic \ntesting guidelines and knowledge about hereditary cancer risk evolve over \ntime, and new family diagnoses may occur making periodic assessment \nimportant . Genetic risk assessment is appropriate for all survivors  of \nbreast cancer , epithelial ovarian cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, \npancreatic cancer, and colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed at age \n50 years or younger. Many other survivors of rare cancers, cancers \ndiagnosed at young ages, multiple primary cancers, or those  with one or \nmore relatives with the same or related cancers are also candidates for \nrisk assessment per guidelines from NCCN and other expert groups.

Although achieving all of these healthy lifestyle goals may be \ndifficult for many survivors, eve n small reductions in weight among \noverweight or obese survivors or small increases in physical activity \namong sedentary individuals are thought to yield meaningful \nimprovements in cancer -specific outcomes and overall health.202 Clinicians \nshould assess individual and  community -level barriers to meeting the \nhealthy lifestyle recommendations and support patients in developing \nstrategies to overcome challenges.  \nPhysical Activity  \nDuring cancer treatment, many survivors become deconditioned and can \ndevelop impaired cardiov ascular fitness because of the direct and \nsecondary effects of therapy.203 Randomized trials have shown that \nexercise training is safe, tolerable, and effective for most survivors. \nStructured aerobic and resistance training programs after treatment can \nimprove  cardiovascular fitness and strength and can have positive effects \non balance, body composition, fatigue, emotional well -being, and quality of \nlife.204-216 The effectiveness of exercise is especially well studied in \npatients  with early -stage breast cancer. Survivors of breast cancer who \nexercise have  improved cardiovascular fitness and therefore an increased \ncapacity to perform daily life functions, resulting in a better quality of \nlife.214,215,217 -219 Furthermore, a study of adult survivors of childhood \nHodgkin lymphoma  found that vigorous exercise was associated with a \nreduction in the risk of  major  cardiovascular  event s after a median follow -\nup of 11.9 years.220 In fact, the finding was dose -dependent, and survivors \nwho reported \u22659 metabolic equivalent (MET ) h/wk experienced a 51% \nreduction in risk compared with those reporting <9 MET h/wk (P = .002).  A similar study in patients with breast cancer found a similar reduction in the \nrisk of cardiovascular events  with \u22659 MET h/wk .221 \nIn addition, observational studies have consistentl y found that p hysical  \nactivity is linked to decreased cancer incidence and recurrence and \nincreased survival for certain tumor types.209,222 -239 For example, one meta -\nanalysis of 6 studies including more than 12,000 survivors of breast \ncancer found that post -diagnosis physical activity reduced all -cause \nmortality by 41% ( P < .00001)  and disease recurrence by 24% ( P = \n.00001).226 Data from other meta -analyses primarily consisting of \nobservational studies of survivors of colorectal, ovarian, non -small cell \nlung, brain, prostate, and breast cancers show that physical activity is \nassociated with decreased all -cause mortality and/or cancer -specific \nmortality.224,227,236,240 In fact, analyses of data from 986 survivors of breast \ncancer  from the National Ru nners' and Walkers' Health Studies  found that \nmortality decreased with increased rates of energy expenditure.237 \nEvidence in other disease sites is less robust, but also suggests survival \nbenefits associated with exercise in survivors after treatment.240 \nData also support the idea that inactivity/sedentary behavior is  a risk factor \nfor cancer incidence  and mortality and impacts mood and quality of life in \nsurvivors,  independent of the level of an individual\u2019s recreational or \noccupational physical activity.192,241 -247 For example, i n a cohort of more \nthan 2000 survivors of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, those who spent \nmore leisure time sitting had a higher  mortality than those who spent more \ntime in recreational activity.192 \nEvaluation

In a \nrandomized controlled trial of 152 fatigued patients with advanced cancer, \ntreatment of accompanying physical symptoms, including pain, nausea, \nvomiting, and shortness of breath, resulted  in a significantly higher impact \non general fatigue, activity, and motivation than usual care.692 \nPatient and Family Education and Counseling  \nEducation and counseling can be beneficial in helping patients cope with \nfatigue. Understanding typical patterns of fatigue during and after \ntreatment can help patients set reasonable expectations regarding \nimprovements in energy after the completion of can cer therapy and can \nhelp allay concerns that persistent fatigue after the completion of therapy \nis evidence of disease recurrence. Counseling can help patients develop \nstrategies for self -monitoring of fatigue and techniques such as energy conservation tha t may be helpful in the immediate post -treatment \nperiod.693 \nPhysical Activity  \nActivity en hancement is a category 1 recommendation for the \nmanagement of fatigue in survivors. Improving strength, energy, and \nfitness through regular exercise, even a moderate -intensity walking \nprogram, has been shown to facilitate the transition from patient to \nsurvivor, decrease anxiety and depression, improve body image, and \nincrease tolerance for physical activity. Therefore, survivors with moderate \nto severe fatigue should be encouraged to maintain adequate levels of \nphysical activity (category 1). Robust data support the efficacy of \nincreased physical activity for reducing fatigue in patients with cancer and \nsurvivors.204,210,215,217,219,560,694 -700 Multiple meta -analyses of randomized \ncontrolled trials have found that cancer survivors who participate in \nexercise interventions, either during or after treatment for cancer, \nexperience significant improvements in fatigue com pared with patients \nrandomized to the control group.204,700 -703 A randomized phase 3 trial that \nincluded 410 cancer survivors showed that a 4-week yoga therapy \nprogra m led to impro vements in fatigue and sleep quality and reductions in \ndaytime dysfunction .704 \nSurvivors at a higher risk of injury should be referred to a physical \ntherapist or exercise specialist (also see Healthy Lifestyles , above ). \nPsychosocial and Other Interventions  \nPsychosocial int erventions, such as CBT, MBSR, psycho -educational \ntherapy, and supportive expressive therapy, including support groups, \ncounseling, and journal writing (all category 1 recommendations), have \nalso been shown to reduce fatigue in cancer survivors, although d ata are \nnot entirely consistent.567,705 -710

They are surviving, \nand their needs have changed. \nSurvivorship care includes recovering \nfrom cancer and promoting health.\nCancer survivors\nOver the past 40 years, cancer care has greatly \nimproved. Cancer screening is finding cancer \nat early stages when it can be fully removed. \nNewer treatments are more precise and better \nat stopping cancer growth.\nWith better cancer care, people with cancer \nare living longer. As a result, the needs of the \ncancer community have changed. More people \nneed help to recover from cancer and its \ntreatment and to be healthy. \nThe term \u201ccancer survivor\u201d was proposed in \nthe 1980s. The intent of the term was to raise \nawareness of better outcomes and changing \nneeds. A person with cancer is a survivor:\n \u0086starting at the time of diagnosis,\n \u0086during and right after treatment, and\n \u0086through the balance of their life.\nSome people do not like or identify with the \nterm survivor. It is not meant to be a label. Its \npurpose is to identify the community of people \nwith a history of cancer. Having a common term \nis useful for improving the care of survivors.Survivorship care\nThe large and rising number of cancer survivors \nneed survivorship care. Survivorship care \nimproves health, wellness, and quality of life. \nStandards of survivorship care are listed in \nGuide 1 . \nPrevention\nPrevention of a new or recurring cancer is a key \npart of survivorship care. You can reduce your \nrisk of cancer with healthy living. Healthy living \nincludes physical activity, eating well, and not \nusing tobacco.\nLess often, medical treatments are used to \nprevent cancer. Some people have surgery to \nremove a body part, like a breast, where cancer \nis likely to start.

Genetic testing guidelines and \nknowledge about hereditary cancer risk evolve over time and new family diagnoses may occur making periodic assessment important. \n\u2022 Comprehensive family history including any prior genetic testing is the first step in genetic risk assessment.\n\u2022 Many cancer survivors, particularly those diagnosed at younger ages, as well as those diagnosed with rare cancers, multiple primary \ncancers, or cancers associated with high-risk cancer syndromes, and those with one or more relatives with the same or related cancers \nare candidates for risk assessment per guidelines from NCCN and other expert groups. Genetic testing is recommended for appropriate \nsurvivors based on results of the risk assessment. (See General Testing Criteria [CRIT-1] from the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial \nHigh-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic)\n\u0017Criteria for formal genetic risk assessment and/or testing, and for care of patients with known germline mutations linked to an increased \nrisk for cancer can be found in the following NCCN Guidelines:\n \u25caNCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial

reconsidered in those with prior negative tests with limited sets of genes.\n\u0017Consider referral for genetic risk assessment for patients who do not meet the criteria but who request it.\n\u2022 Consider referral to genetic counseling services for risk assessment and/or testing if the survivor did not have a comprehensive evaluation \nat time of diagnosis. \n\u2022 Genetic testing may also

These guidelines are focused on options to \nmaintain and enhan ce wellness in cancer survivors who are receiving or \nhave completed active therapy, including  those receiving treatment for \nyears, those who may be in remission, and those who are cured. These \nguidelines are designed to provide a framework for the manageme nt of \nlong-term and/or late effects of cancer and its treatment. T he guidelines \nfocus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment \nof cancer can have on the adult survivor's  health,  physical and mental  \nstates, health behaviors, professional and personal identity, sexuality , and \nfinancial standing . \nThe panel acknowledges  that there is a growing population of cancer \nsurvivors with chronic cancer. This group includes those with incurable \ndisease who are receiving  systemic therapy  continuously  and those  who \nmay be  on treatment  intermittently. Although these guidelines do not \naddress the specific needs of survivors with chronic cancer (eg, \npsychosocial issues related to living for years with a terminal diagnosis \nand u ncertainty about the future; how to handle comorbid conditions and \ndisease prevention, screening, and treatment in the setting of limited life \nexpectancy; managing discussions around new drugs and early -stage \nclinical trials ),15 many of the recommendations in these guidelines are relevant to this population (eg, those around fatigue, anxiety, depression ). \nThe panel emphasizes that these guidelines may be used to guide the \nmanagement of all cancer survivors \u2013 not just those who have completed \ntreatment, but also the population with chronic cancer.  \nThese guidelines  should be used as a supplement to the follow -up \nrecommendations within the disease -specific guidelines (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site, available at www.NCCN.org ) \nand should provide a framework for the coordination of care between the \nsurvivor\u2019s health care providers to ensure that needs are appropriately \naddressed.  \nThese guidelines are not intended to provide guidance for the care of \nsurvivors of childhood cancer (detailed guidelines for the care of childhood \ncancer survivors are available from the Children\u2019s Oncology Group at \nhttp://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/ ). For survivorship issues related to \nyounger populations,  please also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent \nand Young Adult  (AYA) Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org ). For \nsurvivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune -\nmediated toxicities is warranted (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nManagement of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nFor this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Surv ivorship, the panel \nfocused on the preventive health issues including healthy lifestyle \nbehaviors, immunizations and prevention of infection, and cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD) risk assessment and modification . The panel also focused \non several common issues  of survivors: 1) anthracycline -induced cardiac \ntoxicity; 2) anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress; 3) cognitive decline; \n4) fatigue; 5) lymphedema; 6) hormone -related symptoms; 7) pain; 8) \nfemale and male sexual dysfunction;  and 9)  sleep disorders.

\nCoalition for Cancer Survivor and states : \u201cAn individual is considered a \ncancer survivor from the time of diagno sis, through the balance of their \nlife. There are many types of survivors, including those living with cancer \nand those fr ee of cancer. This term is meant to capture a population of \nthose with a history of cancer rather than to provide a label that ma y or \nmay not resonate with individuals .\u201d16  \nThe Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment  \nFor some survivors, the consequences of cancer are minimal; these \npatients can return to a normal life after the completion of treatment. In \nfact, most cancer survivors rep ort being in good general health and \nexperience good to excellent quality of life.17,18 Also, a survey of 659 \nsurvivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers  found that a majority \ndo not suffer from psychologic morbidity or have a large number of unmet \nsupportive care need s.19,20 Other studies have similarly found that most \nsurvivors enjoy a high quality of life without a large number of cancer -\nrelated symptoms.21,22 \nHowever, many survivors do experience physical and/or psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment.23-25 Some sequelae become evident \nduring anticancer treatment (long -term effects), whereas others may not \nmanifest for months or years after active therapy (late effects).  The \nproblems can range from mild to severe,  debilitating, or even life -\nthreatening. Some problems are temporary or improve with time, whereas \nother problems are progressive or permanent. This topic has been well \nreviewed.18,26 \nA literature review suggests that at least 50% of survivors experience \nsome late effect s of cancer treatment.26 The most common problems in \ncancer survivors are depression , pain, and fat igue.27 The exact prevalence of various effects of cancer and its treatment are hard to quantify, because \nfew studies have addressed these issues in a longitudinal fashion, \ncomparing patients with and without a histo ry of cancer to differentiate \nbetween the effects of cancer and the effects of aging.18 In general, the \nprevalence of late effects in cancer survivo rs is believed to have increased \nover time, likely because anticancer interventions have become more \ncomplex and intense with combinations of surgery, radiation,

For some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been \nassociated with a reduced risk of recurrence and death. \n\u2022 Cancer prehabilitation1,2 is appropriate for many newly diagnosed survivors prior to initiating treatment with surgery or chemotherapy. \nReferrals to physical therapy or exercise oncology specialists should be considered.\n\u2022 For optimal health, all survivors should be encouraged to set incremental as well as ultimate goals for diet, physical activity, and weight \nmanagement. At a minimum all survivors should be encouraged to:\n\u0017Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight throughout life (SNWM-2).\n\u0017Avoid inactivity.\n\u0017Engage in physical activity (eg, exercise, take the stairs, park in the back of parking lot) daily (SPA-1).\n\u0017Maintain a healthy diet high in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.\n\u0017Limit intake of red and cured meats and highly processed foods,a,b particularly those high in fats and sugars (SNWM-1).\n\u0017Drink alcohol sparingly if at all (SNWM-1). \n\u0017Discontinue use of cigarettes, other tobacco products (including hookah), and e-cigarettes (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation) .\n\u0017Practice sun safety\n \u25caUtilize a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 that protects against UVA and UVB rays and is water resistant.\n \u25caApply sunscreen generously and reapply every 2 hours or after swimming/excessive sweating.\n \u25caConsider using physical barriers whenever possible (ie, hats, shirts with sleeves, avoiding direct sun during peak hours).\n \u25caDo not use tanning beds.\n \u25caAvoid sunburns.\n \u25caSeek shade and wear protective clothing (ie, hats and long-sleeved garments) if outside for prolonged periods of time or during peak \ndirect sun hours.\n\u0017Strive for at least 7\u20139 hours of sleep on a regular basis (SSD-1).3\n \u25caYounger adults require more sleep.4\n \u25caTeenagers may require 9 or more hours of sleep.4\n\u0017Follow up with PCP regularly.\n \u25caAdhere to age-appropriate and treatment-associated health screening, preventive measures (SIMIN-1), and cancer screening \nrecommendations (NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, & Risk Reduction) .\n\u0017Obtain nutrients from food sources rather than relying on dietary supplements. Routine use of dietary supplements is not recommended \nfor the purposes of cancer control (SSUP-1).\n\u2022 A multidisciplinary approach (including but not limited to clinicians, physical therapists, dieticians, social workers, and patient navigators) \nshould be utilized to:\n\u0017Assess individual and community-level barriers to meeting the healthy lifestyle recommendations.\n\u0017Support patients in developing strategies to overcome challenges throughout the continuum of survivorship care (from diagnosis to long-\nterm survivorship). \n\u0017Consider specialty referrals to supportive programs offered by medical centers or the community (ie, Livestrong at the YMCA).\nFootnotes (HL-1A)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

Identificati on and management of fatigue remain an \nunmet need for many cancer survivors.  \nThe specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of cancer -\nrelated fatigue are unknown. Proposed mechanisms include pro -\ninflammatory cytokines, hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis \ndysregulation, circadian rhythm desynchronization, skeletal muscle \nwasting, and genetic dysregulation.681-686 Several studies have focused on \nthe cause of fatigue, especially in cancer survivors with no evidence of \nactive disease, and have su ggested that persistent immune system \nactivation and chronic inflammatory processes may be involved.666,687 -689 \nEvidence supporting these mechanisms is limited.  \nScreening for Fatigue  \nAll survivors should be screened for fatigue to ensure that those with \nmoderate to severe fatigue are identified and treated promptly and \neffectively. Because fatigue is a subjective experience, clinicians must rely \non patients\u2019 descriptions of their fatigue level. The panel recommends the \nuse of a severity scale, with survivors being asked, \u201cHow would you rate \nyour fatigue on a scale of 0 t o 10 over the past 7 days?\u201d Alternatively, screening can be performed with patients asked to rate their fatigue as \nnone, mild, moderate, or severe. Scores of 0 to 3 or none to mild fatigue \nrequire no further assessment or interventions; these patients shou ld be \nrescreened at regular intervals. Patients with scores of 4 or greater or \nindicating moderate or severe fatigue should be evaluated further. Studies \nin patients with cancer have revealed a marked decrease in physical \nfunctioning at a reported fatigue level of 7 or higher on the 0 to 10 \nscale.690,691 \nEvaluation for Moderate to Severe Fatigue  \nWhen fatigue is rated as moderate to severe, with a score of 4 to 10, a \nmore focused history and physical examination should be conducted. A \nthorough history is warranted, because the recommended workup for \nfatigue differs according to the timing of fatigue onset in relation to the \ncompletion of active therapy and the presence of predisposing factors and \nother symptoms. Fatigue has a variable natural history, with some patients \ncomplain ing of only mild levels of fatigue even during active therapy and \nothers experiencing severe fatigue for years after treatment completion.  \nIn general, mild to moderate levels of fatigue that persist for 6 to 12 \nmonths after the completion of therapy do not warrant an extensive \nworkup, unless other symptoms are present. Conversely, when moderate \nto severe fatigue begins after or worsens during  this period, or when other \nsymptoms are present, such as pain, pulmonary complaints, or \nunintentional weight loss, a more extensive workup is warranted to screen \nfor the presence of metastatic disease or other comorbidities. Refer ral to a \npulmonologist should be made for pulmonary complaints . \nRegardless of fatigue onset, it is always relevant to screen for common \ncontributing factors such as emotional distress, sleep disturbance, pain, \nand the use of prescriptions or over -the-counter medications or \nsupplem ents.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85971de5-f783-4c88-a24b-ff467e04cbdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "85971de5-f783-4c88-a24b-ff467e04cbdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf5e7431-d253-4378-8bab-1eae5541881b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "68f0e34faad7036cb08c6145827bbf92023199ad9d48dcf64baf43855f5e2a56"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cf86178-05d2-47a1-b6c0-82f1f262d211", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "c2d22d86eb3504124e2c411e83c3171e06d9fab4bd23fb3e3aac80ac5a62440d"}}, "hash": "09d1979b81d942245c9fdd6f64c3f42c64bbf214b16f0344a28e581c6c2aecf9", "text": "Possible medical causes of fatigue, including cardiac \ndisease, gastrointestinal or hepatic dysfunction, and hypothyroidism ,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b384ccd-35ed-4f29-a1d7-76f7246411c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b384ccd-35ed-4f29-a1d7-76f7246411c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2151e440-1890-4738-8cb8-fb1de4b18f71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "147", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "5b7e74023cce1d8bef93e04291af520b5ed491dd3fc33b6639cdcabffc1971ed"}}, "hash": "5b7e74023cce1d8bef93e04291af520b5ed491dd3fc33b6639cdcabffc1971ed", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-7 Standards for Survivorship Care  \nIn 2005, the  Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now known as the National \nAcademy of  Medicine [NAM]) and the National Research Council compiled \na report  entitled , \u201cFrom Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in \nTransition. \u201d28 The NCCN Survivorship Panel adapted  the essential \ncomponents of survivorship care from the report:  \n1. Prevention of new and recurrent  cancers and other late effects  \n2. Surveillance for cancer spread , recurrence, or subsequent cancers  \n3. Assessment of late psychosocial , physical , and immunologic \neffects   \n4.

Cancer survivors with \nuntreated distress have poorer compliance with surveillance screenings \nand are less likely to exercise and quit smoking.120 A 2008 IOM report, \n\u201cCancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health \nNeeds, \u201d121 concluded that psychosocial screening and care should be a \npart of the new standard for quality cancer care and should be integrated \ninto routine care across the trajectory of cancer, which inc ludes the period \nafter active treatment . See the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management \n(available at www.NCCN.org ) and Anxiety and Depression  below for \nrecommendations on screening for and treating distress.  \nIn September  2011, the LIVESTRONG Foundation convened a meeting of \nexperts and stakeholders in the survivorshi p field to define essential elements of survivorship care.  After 2 days of consensus building, the \ngroup agreed on the following elements that all medical settings must \nprovide for cancer survivors, either directly or through referral \n(http://images.livestrong.org/downloads/flatfiles/what -we-do/our -\napproach/reports/ee/EssentialElementsBrief.pdf ): \n1. Survivorship care plan, psychosocial care plan, and treatment \nsummary  \n2. Screening for new cancers and surveillance for recurrence  \n3.

However , many cancer survivors report that fatigue may be a \ndisruptive symptom months or years after treatment ends.\n\u0017Fatigue that initially presents months after the completion of adjuvant therapy or fatigue that worsens over this period warrants additional \nevaluation.\n\u2022 Fatigue is a subjective experience that should be systematically assessed using patient self-reports and other sources of data for cancer \nsurvivors in the months and years after diagnosis.\n\u2022 Patients and family/caregiver(s) should be informed that management of fatigue is an integral part of total health care and that fatigue can \npersist following treatment.\n\u2022 Medical care contracts should include reimbursement for the management of fatigue.\n\u2022 Disability insurance should include coverage for the continuing effects of fatigue.\n\u2022  Referral to rehabilitation services including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and physical medicine should be considered for \nsurvivors with fatigue in the months and years after cancer diagnosis.\n\u2022 Also see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20caebaf-9875-4de3-8d81-7025cac7695f": {"__data__": {"id_": "20caebaf-9875-4de3-8d81-7025cac7695f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c60953c2-c1f1-44bf-8e5b-926d4d4474ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "da59f6b24c2f5beab718446bb5a13d15d26ea6efc474fb403a5f0c622f55d9b5"}}, "hash": "da59f6b24c2f5beab718446bb5a13d15d26ea6efc474fb403a5f0c622f55d9b5", "text": "Resources  Support programs\nSexual and fertility effects\nLivestrong\nlivestrong.org/we-can-help/livestrong-fertility\nOncoLink\noncolink.org/support/sexuality-fertility/sexuality\nThe Oncofertility Consortium\noncofertility.northwestern.edu/for-patients\nSleep effects\nNational Cancer Institute\ncancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/\nsleep-disorders-pdq\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \nnhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-\nawareness/sleep-health\nSupport programs\nCancer Hope Network Get Matched \nProgram\ncancerhopenetwork.org/get-support/get-\nmatched\nGood Days\nmygooddays.org/patients\nLeukemia & Lymphoma Society\nlls.org/support-resources\nSave Your Skin\nsaveyourskin.ca/patient-support-webinarsHelp lines\nAmerican Cancer Society\n1.800.227.2345\nAmerican Lung Association\n1.800.LUNGUSA\nAmerican Psychosocial Oncology Society\n1.866.276.7443\nBe the Match\u00ae\n1.888.999.6743\nCancer Support Community\n1.888.793.9355\nLeukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS)\n1.800.955.4572\nLivestrong\n1.855.220.7777\nNational Cancer Institute\n1.800.4.CANCER\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline\n1.800.273.TALK", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "337132d8-3c84-4cc5-8837-845c7b424342": {"__data__": {"id_": "337132d8-3c84-4cc5-8837-845c7b424342", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25741ab0-9bf7-410a-96cd-81eaca21f715", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "96e47c1d94e532c109cd98c9f907674466e966f85a059609160f6dd7f40a9cfb"}}, "hash": "96e47c1d94e532c109cd98c9f907674466e966f85a059609160f6dd7f40a9cfb", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-53 Gynecomastia  \nGynecomastia and breast pain can be treated in patients  on ADT b y \nprophylactic radiation (must be delivered prior to development of breast \ntissue), tamoxifen, or reduction mammoplasty.791,940,941  \nAnemia  \nAnemia in patients  on ADT is generally responsive to erythropoietin (EPO)  \nor blood transfusion.

Barriers to optimal pain \nmanagement in cancer survivor s include health care providers\u2019 lack of \ntraining, fear of side effects and addiction, and reimbursement issues.947 \nPain has two predominant mechanisms: nociceptive and  neuropathic.948,949 \nInjury to somatic and visceral structures and the resulting activation of \nnociceptors present in skin, viscera, muscles, and connective tissues \ncause nociceptive pain. Somatic nociceptive pain is often d escribed as \nsharp, throbbing, or pressure -like, and often occurs after surgical \nprocedures. Visceral nociceptive pain is often diffuse and described as \naching or cramping.  Neuropathic pain is caused by injury to the peripheral \nnervous system or CNS  and might be described as numbness or as \nburning, sharp,  tingling, prickling, electrical,  or shooting  pain. Neuropathic \npain often occurs as a side  effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or \nis caused by  surgical injury to the nerves.  The incidence of  chronic pain after surgical treatment varies with the type \nof procedure and is as high as 60% in patients treated with breast surgery \nand 50% in those treated with lung surgery.942 Arthralgias, characterized \nby joint pain and stiffness, occur in roughly half of patients  taking \naromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.950 Pelvic pain \noften oc curs after pelvic radiation, resulting from fractures, fistulae, \nproctitis, cystitis, dyspareunia, or enteritis.942 \nThese NCCN Guidelin es for Survivorship make recommendations for the \nmanagement of seven categories of cancer pain syndromes: neuropathic \npain, chronic pain syndromes (ie, pain syndromes after amputation, neck \ndissection, mastectomy, thoracotomy), myalgias/arthralgias, skelet al pain, \nmyofascial pain, gastrointestinal/urinary/pelvic pain, and postradiation \npain. Recommendations for the p revention and management of  \nchemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in survivors can be \nfound in ASCO\u2019s clinical practice guideline .951 ASCO also has a clinical \npractice guideline  for the management of chronic pain in survivors of adult \ncancers.952  \nScreening for and Assessment of Pain  \nAll cancer  survivors  should be screened for pa in at regular intervals.  If \npain is present , the intensity should be quantified by the survivor. Because \npain is inherently subjective, self -report of pain is the current standard of \ncare for assessment. Intensity of pain should be quantified using a 0 to 10 \nnumeric rating scale, a categorical scale, or a pictorial scale (eg, Wong -\nBaker FACES  Pain Rating Scale ).953-956 In addition, the survivor should be \nasked to describe the characteristics of the pain ( eg, aching, burn ing). \nSevere uncontrolled pain is a medical emergency and should be \naddressed promptly.", "start_char_idx": null,

The report also \nacknowledged the limited data available  to inform their recommendations.  \nIn 2017, ASCO released a c linical practice guideline  for the prevention and \nmonitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult cancers.493 The \nASCO panel gave a moderate -strength recommendation (as based on evidence and the balance between harms and benefits) that \nechocardiogram can be performed for asymptomatic survivors deemed to \nbe at increased risk for  cardiac dysfunction at 6 to 12 months after \ntreatment, including survivors with a history of anthracycline therapy. \nInsufficient evidence prevented the ASCO panel from making a \nrecommendation regarding the frequency and duration of additional \nsurveillance  of survivors who are asymptomatic and who showed no signs \nof cardiac dysfunction on initial assessment.  \nThe NCCN Survivorship Panel defined its screening recommendations \nbased largely on consensus and on the idea that early recognition and \ntreatment of ca rdiotoxicity can allow for earlier interventions that may \nimprove prognosis (discussed below).  \nAssessment for Symptoms of Heart Failure  \nAccording to the 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines, the cardinal manifestations of \nclinical heart failure (Stage C) include dyspne a and fatigue (which may \nlead to limited exercise tolerance) or fluid retention (which may lead to \npulmonary and peripheral edema).494 These symptoms  can lead to \ndecreased functional capacity and affect quality of life. Heart failure \nsymptoms associated with fluid retention may also include orthopnea or \nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Therefore, the panel recommends a \nhistory and physical to look for these symptoms to help identify survivors \nwho might already be symptomatic. These survivors should  undergo \nevaluation with  an echocardiogram . If no evidence of structural heart \ndisease is seen, then a workup for other causes of the  symptoms is \nwarranted with referral to other specialties (eg, pulmonology or cardiology) \nas needed.

However, discussions about work are ideally best had before treatment begins so that treatment recommendations \ncan take work needs into consideration if possible. \n\u2022 Symptoms affecting work may wax and wane with a survivor\u2019s treatments or disease status, especially if they are living chronically with \ncancer or the consequences of cancer treatment. Some survivors might start and stop working more than once.\n\u2022 Most existing literature focuses on unemployment and/or those who do not return to work. However, underemployment and/or work \nlimitations due to cancer or side effects are also common.\n\u2022 Employment helps to protect survivors from financial toxicity and, at least in the United States, is frequently tied to health insurance access. \nThis can be a main reason survivors work even when/if they are not fully recovered.\n\u2022 Employment is an important source of personal interaction, normalcy , and social support. The psychosocial effects/advantages derived from \nwork may include a sense of purpose, emotional well-being, link to identity , improved quality of life, connection with others, and distraction.\n\u2022 Some populations are at increased risk for difficulties related to work (based on factors such as gender , age, race, ethnicity, cancer type, \ncancer stage, rural residence, educational attainment, etc). The increased difficulties in these populations are more likely for survivors \nwith physically or cognitively demanding jobs or jobs with limited flexibility in scheduling or tasks. Additionally, patients with cancer may \nexperience discrimination as a result of diagnosis/illness, and this may be a consideration for some individuals in decisions surrounding \nemployment.\n\u2022 Survivors should be offered information to help them understand their likely ability to work, take into account their finances and personal/\nfamily needs, and discuss potential work accommodations with their employers.1 \n\u2022 Clinicians should regularly re-evaluate work-related concerns post active cancer treatment or for persons living chronically with cancer .\n\u0017Periodically identify goals and barriers regarding work with survivor  (SWORK-3).\n\u0017A team approach may be needed. Consider early involvement of social work, primary care, physical therapy/occupational therapy, cancer \nrehabilitation, and/or career counseling services, if available.\n\u0017Employment disability forms are not typically well-suited to cancer .

Injury or stress on the myocardium (such as during and after \ntreatment with anthracyclines) can lead to activation of endogenous \nneurohormonal systems, which play a critical role i n cardiac remodeling \nand therefore progre ssion to Stage B heart failure.  \nThe panel recommends that heart failure risk factors, including \nhypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome , and diabetes , be addressed in \nall survivors  who have completed anthracycline  therapy . In addition, \nsurvivors with a history of anthracycline therapy should be advised to  \nengage in regular physical activity, eat a healthy diet, and avoid behaviors \nthat may increase the risk of heart failure or CVD  (eg, cigarette/ tobacco or \nillicit drug use). Physical activity has been shown to improve control of \nhypertension and to slow cardiac remodeling in breast cancer survivors \nwith heart failure.507 Involvement of the survivor\u2019s primary care provider in \nmanaging risk factors is encouraged.  \nThe panel recommends that a low threshold be established for referral to a \ncardio -oncologist or cardiologist for all patients previously treated with an \nanthracycline. Additional recommendations for each sta ge of heart failure \nare discussed below.  Treatment of Stage A Heart Failure  \nStage A heart failure recognizes several well -established risk factors , each \nof which contribute to early stage s of heart failure. These include \nhypertension, CAD , diabetes mellitus, a family history of heart failure , or a \nhistory of cardiotoxins such as anthracyclines. Therefore, all survivors  with \nexposure to anthracyclines have, by definition, at least one risk factor that \npredisposes them to cardiac disease  and s hould be treated  as \nappropriate. Other anti -cancer systemic therapies are potentially \ncardiotoxic and may increase the risk of cardiac disease.439 Involvement of \nthe survivor\u2019s PCP in the management of survivors with cardiac risk \nfactors is encouraged. Management can include addressing under lying \nrisk factors, recommending physical activity and healthy dietary habits, \nand referral to a cardiologist.  \nTreatment of Stages B, C, and D Heart Failure  \nThe panel recommends referral to a cardiologist for all survivors with \nStages B, C, or D heart fail ure.

The panel recognizes that not all individuals with a history of cancer identify with the term \"survivor.\" These guidelines \nare meant to be inclusive and use the term \"survivor\" to describe anyone with a history of cancer.\n\u2022 These guidelines focus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer have on the adult survivor. This \nincludes the potential impact on physical and mental states, health behaviors, professional and personal identity , sexuality, and financial \nstanding. It is appropriate to counsel on these impacts early in the treatment trajectory and at regular intervals thereafter.\n\u2022 These guidelines are applicable to survivors across the continuum of care, including those on prolonged therapy, those with chronic \ncancers (eg, metastatic disease), and long-term survivors.\n\u2022 The panel recognizes the growing population of individuals who are living with metastatic disease and that many aspects of these guidelines \npertain to this population of survivors. This group is included in the definition of survivorship, and these guidelines are meant to be applied \nwhen helpful to meet the individuals' needs. \n\u2022 The panel recommends reviewing the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship in conjunction with the cancer-specific guidelines for individuals \nwith metastatic disease.

These include survivorship clinics \nwithin academic or community cancer centers, community survivorship \nclinics run by primary care clinicians, and survivorship care in the primary \ncare setting.125-130 In each case, survivorship care is delivered by either \nphysicians or by advanced practice clinicia ns such as nurse \npractitioners .131 Each model has advantages and disadvantages, and no \none model is clearly the best for all situations.  \nWith the population of  cancer survivors g rowing at a rapid pace, the \ndemand for follow -up care is expected to increase. An increasing \nproportion of this care will likely be performed by primary care teams. In \nfact, a systematic review identified specific needs of cancer survivors in \nthe primary c are setting, including psychosocial needs, cancer/survivor \ninformation needs, and medical need s.132 Because studies have shown \nthat primary care providers often do not know how best to care for the \nspecific concerns  and needs of cancer survivors,6,133 -138 education  for \nprimary health  care providers regarding appropriate survivorship care  will \nbe increasingly important.139 \nA study in the Netherlands found that patients with cancer 2 to 5 years \nafter d iagnosis increased their number of consultations with primary care \ncompared with age - and sex -matched controls without cancer by 15% for \ncolorectal cancer ( P < .05), 24% for breast cancer ( P < .001), and 33% for \nprostate cancer ( P < .001).140 These survivors also had mor e chronic \nconditions than controls. Although an American study using the SEER -\nMedicare database showed a smaller increase in primary care use by breast cancer survivors (10% increase in year 4 after diagnosis;  P < \n.05),141 these results show that PCPs are providing a s ubstantial amount \nof survivorship care. In fact, according to IOM analyses of the 2001 and \n2002 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital \nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey, approximately one -third of the more \nthan 36 million cancer -related visits to physicians\u2019 offices were made to \nprimary care.28 Furthermore, a nationally representative survey by NCI  \nand the ACS found that >50% of PCPs provide survivors with cancer -\nrelated follow -up care, often with co -management by oncologists.142 \nIn a survey of survivors regarding their preferences for follow -up care, \nmost participants said t hat the PCP should only provide care if the \nresponsibility was shared with the oncologist.143 One of the reasons \ncommonly cited for this preference was that surv ivors believe their PCPs \nlack the needed expertise to deal with their specific issues. In addition, \nsurvivors cited a desire for continuity of care. Additional surveys of \nsurvivors of breast cancer in the United States  and of survivors of breast, \ncolorecta l, and prostate cancer in the United Kingdom  found similar \npreference s for oncologist -driven follow -up care over PCP follow -up \ncare.144,145 Importantly, however, two randomized trials compar ing \nsurvivorship care administered by PCPs (provided guideline s outlining \nappropriate follow -up care ) versus  oncologists  found no difference in \ndisease -related outcomes, including survival.146,147 \nSurvivorship Care Planning   \nBecause primary care offices are in fact already caring for cancer \nsurvivors, it is critical for information to be shared between oncology and \nprimary care teams.

Physical activity and exercise recommendations should be tailored to \nindividual survivors\u2019 abilities and preferences.  \n2. Survivors who are able should be encouraged to engage in daily \nphysical activity , including exercise, routine activities, and \nrecreation al activities .  \n3. All survivors should be encouraged to limit sedentary behavior (eg, \nsitting for long periods)  and return to daily activities as soon as \npossible.  \n4. Physical activity for cancer survivors:  \n\u2022 Overall volume of weekly activity should be at least  150 to 300 \nminutes of moderate -intensity activity or 75 minutes of \nvigorous -intensity activity, or an equivalent combination spread \nout over the course of the we ek; \n\u2022 Individuals should engage in 2 to 3 sessions per week of \nstrength training (see Resistance T raining , below) that include \nmajor muscle groups; and  \n\u2022 Major muscle groups should be stretched at least 2 days per \nweek  on days that other exercises are performed .  \n \nThe panel acknowledges that m ost survivors do not meet  these exercise \nrecommendations , and a significant portion reports that they perform no \nleisure -time activity.183,264 However, the evidence suggests that ev en light -\nintensity physical activity can improve physical functioning in survivors.265 \nFor survivors who are inactive, clinicians should not advise the immediate \ninitiation of a high -intensity, hig h-frequency program.266,267 Instead, the \npanel suggests that clinicians provide sufficient information to encourage \nsurvivors to avoid a sedentary lifestyle .253 Survivors and providers should work together to address barriers to physical activity and develop \nincremental short - and long -term physical activity goals. These goals may \ninclude increment al increases in time spent in physical activity or in \nintensity of activity over time. The panel suggested a possible initial \nphysical activity prescription (starting inactive survivors with 1 to 3 light -\n/moderate -intensity sessions of 20 minutes or more p er week), with \nprogression based on tolerance.266 For survivors tolerating the minimum \nguideline recommendations, clinicians should consider encouraging  \nincremental increases in time spent in physical activity or in intensity of \nactivity . Walking and using a s tationary bike are safe for virtually all \nsurvivors.  \nResistance Training  \nThe health benefits of resistance training include improvement in muscle \nstrength and endurance, improvements in functional status, and \nmaintenance/improvement in bone density. Core and strength training is \nimportant to maintain balance and minimize fall r isk.

CVD-related comorbidity and mortality may detrimentally affect patients with \ncancer and survivors with short- and long-term sequelae. Counseling regarding cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle modifications are \nparamount in cancer survivors and patients with favorable prognoses. The risk of CVD-related death varies with years from diagnosis, with \nmost survivors being at greatest risk 5 or more years after diagnosis and completion of curative therapy.\n\u2022 Referral to a cardiologist or cardio-oncologist in patients at elevated CVD risk should be considered at any stage of the cancer journey .\n\u2022 Shared risk factors for both cancer and CVD (ie, smoking, poor health behaviors) contribute to the development of CVD and structural heart \ndisease or heart failure, a concept that becomes especially relevant to cancer survivors. Attention and counseling regarding shared risk \nfactors may improve cancer- and cardiovascular-related outcomes.\n\u2022 Cancer treatments (immunotherapy,a cytotoxic and targeted systemic therapies,b RT) can result in diverse cardiovascular issues, including \ncardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis after head and neck and mantle \nradiation, and cerebrovascular accidents.\n\u0017Survivors treated with anthracyclines are at increased risk for heart failure (SCARDIO-1).\n\u0017Androgen or estrogen deprivation therapy may elevate cardiovascular risk.c\n\u2022 Most CVDs (such as atherosclerosis) develop over time as a result of well-defined risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, use of \ntobacco products, obesity, and diabetes. Control of these risk factors can decrease the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. \n\u2022 Survivors should be assessed throughout the survivorship continuum for:\n\u0017Pre-existing and emerging CVD (eg, CAD, CHF, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation) and CVD risk factors \n(eg, hypertension, dislipidemia, obesity, cigarette/tobacco use, diabetes mellitus), with intervention for modifiable risk factors as necessary\n\u0017Cancer treatment history (eg, regimen/dose,b radiation field, dose/volume)\n\u0017Diet and exercise habits\n\u2022 Tools exist to help quantify atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk (eg, ASCVD risk scored).\n\u2022 Survivors should be counseled on any increased risk of CVD they may have based on prior treatment, comorbidity, or CVD risk factors and \non the ABCDEs of CVD Prevention (see Table 1 on SCVD-2).\n\u2022 Cooperation and shared care with primary care providers, and cardiovascular specialists as needed, is key to optimizing cardiac and \nvascular outcomes in cancer survivors. \n\u2022 Consider referral to cardio-oncology or a cardiology specialist for high-risk survivors.e\na Drobni ZD, Alvi RM, Taron J, et al.

Survivors \nmay be discharged from the care of their oncolog ist and feel isolated and \nscared. Furthermore, their primary care physicians (PCPs), who may now \nbe responsible for their care, often do not know how best to care for the \nspecific concerns and needs of cancer survivors.6 ASCO\u2019s statement, \n\u201cAchieving High -Quality Cancer Survivorship Care,\u201d cites a need for \nstandardized, evidence -based practice guidelines for the management of \ntreatment effects and heal th promotion of survivors.7 ASCO, NCCN, ACS, \nand other groups that are working in parallel hope to provide this \nguidance.8-12 The NCCN S urvivorship  Panel is comprised of a multidisciplinary panel of \nexperts  that includes at least one oncologist, bone marrow transplant \nclinician , gynecologist, urologist, infectious disease specialist , cardiologist, \nPCP, psychologist, nutrition scientist, nurse , epidemi ologist, social worker, \nand patient advocate.

Several studies have shown that unemployment rates for \nsurvivors are higher than for the general population.87-90 Furthermore, \nthose survivors who do return to work often encounter difficulties, such as \nphysical or c ognitive limitations, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and \nperceived or real discrimination.87,91,92 \nSeveral studies  have addressed factors that predict a delayed return to \nwork.93-99 For example, a French p opulation -based study revealed that \nclinical factors, such as severity of the cancer, receipt of chemotherapy , or \nthe experience of adverse effec ts, were associated with a delay in return \nto work.97 In addition, a systematic review of cohort studies found that \nsurvivors who were o lder, had a lower educa tion level, or had a  lower \nincome  were less likely to return to work.98 Another systematic review \nidentified factors related to the person ( eg, symptoms, coping, motivation), \nenvironmental supports ( eg, family, workplace), and occupation ( eg, type \nof work, job flexibility)  that impacted successful return to work after cancer \ntreatment.100 \nSome interventions to enhance return -to-work in cancer survivors have \nbeen studied (eg, psycho -education , physical training, vocational \ncounseling ), although additional research in this area is greatly needed .101-\n104 Multidisciplinary interventions that combine vocational counseling with \nother elements (eg,  patient education, patient counseling, behavioral \ntraining , physical exercises ) may increase rates of  return -to-work \ncompared to usual care.

A more r ecent study found that the excess annual \nhealth  care expenditures of cancer survivors averaged about $4400, and \nthat the t otal mean annual direct health care expenditure for cancer \nsurvivors  increased by about $1000 in the period from 2009 to 2010 to the \nperiod from  2015  to 2016 .109 Other recent studies also found  that cancer \nsurvivors have greater out -of-pocket expenses and are more likely to \nexperience material hardship than those without a history of cancer.110,111 \nYounger cancer survivors seem to be particular ly vulnerable to the \nfinancial effects of cancer.111-113 \nClearly, with lost wages and increased expenses, the fin ancial burden on \nmany cancer survivors is great.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8c6255b-66f6-40ba-9b50-e499d0d76e25": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8c6255b-66f6-40ba-9b50-e499d0d76e25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f244f1d-9c44-42f1-8c1a-26030c2ca45f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "cca2d62d3127ac8724bce985ade13608ef0754cc9cb5bc3ae0b2a5855d924bf5"}, "2": {"node_id": "645d3169-c1c1-465b-a2f6-6642655b3863", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "46c4dbaa849464b59f6499910dc63370cef487ccee751f68584ec1efc37858d9"}}, "hash": "1a9868c0b69a558b4535951a22b7f6e026cd65a19eda370337976d35ab8a3ff6", "text": "Recent data suggest that patients \nbelonging to racial and ethnic minorities are more  likely to suffer financial \nhardship after cancer treatment.114,115 Furthermore, the financial burden \nassociated with cancer treatment and survivorship can lower health -\nrelated quality of life , increase  psychologic distress, and impact adherence \nto prescribed medications.116-119", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6eacca1-6d4e-440e-b584-f5cf6144cb43": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6eacca1-6d4e-440e-b584-f5cf6144cb43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b3f8ed6-9968-4c77-9946-035a4cccb671", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "9fb935a775257026b367e191032a0fb3651874a845fc3a28b51678881a9ac138"}}, "hash": "9fb935a775257026b367e191032a0fb3651874a845fc3a28b51678881a9ac138", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-46 patients  randomized to the education plus exercise arm self -reported \ngreater range of motion  at 12 months after lymph node dissection (a pre -\nspecified secondary outcome) compared with patients  in the education \nonly arm (left, 91% vs . 84%; P = .16; right, 90% vs . 83%; P = .02 ).779 \nFinally, survivors can be informed that w ater exercise under supervision \nmay be an option to consider in the absence of  any skin integrity and/or \nincision issues.780 In a controlled clinical intervention study, 88 patients \nwith lymphedema second ary to cancer participated in either a water -based \nor land -based exercise program .780 A higher proportion of those  who \nperformed water exercises experienced a reduction in  their secondary arm \nlimb volume ( P = .029)  and self -reported frequency of swelling ( P = .031) . \nSurveillance of Survivors with Lymphedema  \nSurvivors with lymphedema should have follow -up with the treat ment team \nas clinically indicated.

Common barriers include not having enough time \nto exercise, not hav ing access to an acceptable exercise environment, \nuncertainty about safety of exercise post -treatment, lack of knowledge \nregarding appropriate activities, and physical limitations.250 Alleviation of \npain, fatigue, distress, or nutritional deficits can facilitate the initiation of an \nexercise program.  \nRisk Assessment for Exercise -Induced Adverse Events  \nExercise is considered safe for most survivors .214,215,251 However, a \nsignificant portion of survivors may have comorbid conditions or risk \nfactors that make them unable to safely exercise without trained \nsupervision.252 Therefore, a risk assessment is required for all survivors \nbefore prescribing a specific exercise program.214,253 The type of cancer, \ntreatment modalities received, and the number and severity of \ncomorbidities determine risk levels.251 Thus, disease and treatment \nhistory, late and long -term effects, and comorbidities should be assessed. \nA standardized pre-participa tion screening questionnaire, such as the \nPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone  (PAR-Q+),254 can \nalso be considered to identify patients for whom unsupervised physical \nactivity is likely safe versus those for whom it may pose undue risk.  \nSurvivors with peripheral neuropathy, poor bone health, a rthritis , or \nmusculoskeletal issues  are considered to be at moderate risk for exercise -\ninduced adverse events. Stability , balance,  and gait should be assessed in \nsurvivors with peripheral neuropathy and possibly in survivors with poor \nbone health before they engage  in exercise , and exercise choice should \nbe made based on the results (ie, stationary bike or water aerobics for \nsurvivors with poor balance).  In addition, balance training can be \nrecommended for patients at risk for  falls. Moderate -risk survivors can \noften follow the general recommendations for physical activity; however, medical clearance and/or referrals to trained personnel such as a physical \nor occupational therapist, certified exercise professional , or rehabilit ation \nspecialist can also be considered.  Specialized training in working with \nsurvivors is available for both physical therapists and exercise \nprofessionals through the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM; \nhttp://www.acsm.org/get -certified ) and the American Physical Therapy \nAssociation (APTA) Oncology section ( http://oncologypt.org/ ). Survivors \nshould be encouraged to use an ACSM - or APTA -certified trainer when \navailable.  \nLymphedema is not a contraindication for physical activity, and no special \nprecautions are required for cardiovascular/aerobic exercise or strength \ntraining of unaffec ted limbs  (see Survivor Lymphedema Education, \nbelow ).255-260 Progressive resistance training under supervision is \nrecommended as part of treatment for survivors with lymphedema (see \nTreatment  of Lymphedema, above).  \nSurvivors at high risk for exercise -assoc iated adverse events include \nthose with a history of lung surgery or major abdominal surgery, an \nostomy, cardiopulmonary comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease [COPD], congestive heart failure [ CHF], coronary artery disease \n[CAD ], cardiom yopathy), ataxia, s evere nutritional deficiencies , severe \nfatigue, or worsening/changing physical condition (eg, lymphedema \nexacerbation).", "start_char_idx": null,

increasing physical activity and other healthy behaviors in cancer \nsurvivors.302,303 Motivational interviewing  focuses on exploring the \nsurvivor\u2019s thoughts, wants, and feelings and is directed at moving \nambivalence so survivors choose to change their behavior.396 Other \nbehavioral strategies may also be useful, such as improving self -efficacy \n(ie, the belief that one c an perform the actions of new activity and maintain \nthis practice by addressing barriers and planning for behavior change) and \nself-monitoring.397,398 Clinicians can consider referral to a provider trained \nin the techniques o f motivational interviewing.  \nImmunizations and Prevention of Infections  \nCancer survivors are at elevated risk for infection because of immune \nsuppression associated with previous cancer treatments, such as \nchemotherapy, radiation, corticosteroids, certain surgeries, and stem cell \ntransplantation. In fact, antibody titers to vaccine -preventable diseases \ndecrease after anti -cancer treatment.399,400 In addition, survivors are at \nincreased risk of complications from vaccine -preventable diseases, such \nas those caused by HPV and influenza viruses.400,401  \nMany infections in survivors can be prevented by the use of vaccines. \nHowever, data from the BRFSS found that 42% of survivors did not \nreceive an influenza vaccinati on in 2009, and 52% reported never \nreceiving a pneumococcal vaccination.183 Analysis of the SEER -Medicare \ndatabase showed that survivors  of breast cancer, aged  \u226565 years, were \nless likely to receive an influenza vaccination than matched non -cancer \ncontrols.141 A separate analysis of the SEER -Medicare database by \nanother group found similar results.402 \nVaccines represent a unique challenge in cancer and transplant survivors, \nbecause they may or may not trigger the desired protective immune \nresponses due to possible residual immune deficits.403-405 In addition, certain vaccines, such as those that are live attenuated (eg, zoster [ZVL, \nMMRV, or VAR]; MMR), are contraindicated in active ly \nimmunosuppressed survivors because of an increased risk of developing \nthe disease and/or prolonged shedding of the live organism given in the \nvaccine.  \nRisk Assessment and Screening for Immunizations and Prevention of \nInfections  \nSurvivors are at elevated risk for infections if their cancer treatment \nincluded chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab, \nalemtuzumab), radiation, corticosteroids, splenectomy,  CAR T -cell \ntherapy , and/or HCT (which includes peripheral blood stem cell \ntransplanta tion, bone marrow transplantation, and cord blood \ntransplantation). Risk is also elevated if the survivor has prior or current \nexposure to endemic infections or epidemics, or has a history of blood \ntransfusion.  \nInterventions for Prevention of Infections  \nInfection in survivors can be prevented by education, antimicrobial \nprophylaxis, and the judicious use of vaccines. For information regarding \nantimicrobial prophylaxis, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Prevention \nand Treatment of Cancer -Related Infections (available online at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nEducation  \nSurvivors should be educated about safe pet care, the avoidance of \nzoonosis, travel precautions, gardening precautions , proper hand hygiene , \nand avoidance of respiratory droplets  during a respiratory virus \npandemic .406-413 Contact with pets did not increase the risk of fever, \nbacteremia, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis in children with acute myeloid \nleukemia  (AML) ,414 and the panel believes that contact with pets is \ngenerally safe for most survivors.

In the absence of known harm, administration of inactivated vaccines with the \nhope of achieving some protection may be worthwhile. The usual doses and schedules are recommended.a,b,c \n\u0017Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Years or Older, United States: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/\ndownloads/adult/adult-combined-schedule.pdf\n\u2022 Vaccines as a strategy to prevent infection represents a unique challenge in cancer and transplant survivors. Vaccines may not trigger \nprotective immune responses in actively immunocompromised individuals or in survivors with residual immune deficits. In addition, certain \nvaccines such as those that are live attenuated (eg, measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) are contraindicated in actively immunosuppressed \nindividuals because of a proven or theoretical increased risk of prolonged shedding and disease from the live organism present in the \nvaccine; other live attenuated vaccines might also be contraindicated in survivors\u2019 close contacts. When other vaccine options exist, they \nshould be preferred over live attenuated vaccines in survivors (eg, recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]). \n\u2022 Ideally, clinicians should have administered all indicated vaccines to patients before initiation of cancer treatment (if possible, at least 2 \nweeks before cancer treatment).d\n\u0017Inactivated or recombinant vaccines should be administered 2 or more weeks before cancer treatment and 3 or more months after cancer \nchemotherapy. While this schedule is preferred, the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) can be administered during cancer treatment. \n\u0017Live viral vaccinese can be administered 4 or more weeks before cancer treatment or 3 or more months after cancer chemotherapy, but \nconsultation with an infectious disease specialist or physician familiar with vaccination in survivors and/or patients with cancer is strongly \nrecommended. \n\u0017COVID-19 vaccine is recommended as appropriate. See NCCN COVID-19 Resources: https://www.nccn.org/covid-19\n\u2022 In survivors who received anti\u2013B-cell antibody therapy, vaccination should be delayed for at least 6 months after chemotherapy and the last \ndose of such therapy.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNIZATIONS", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6537510b-f073-49a8-ad67-0ced2ad620c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6537510b-f073-49a8-ad67-0ced2ad620c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e3c4fdf-789b-45de-aa5e-cdd11f8e83cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "25c80f57e538a9c4b026fa9c8ded3909170bacadb0204e4604c8d2f45bece57c"}}, "hash": "25c80f57e538a9c4b026fa9c8ded3909170bacadb0204e4604c8d2f45bece57c", "text": "Physical activity  Cancer-related challenges\nCancer-related challenges\nCancer and its treatment can make physical \nactivity challenging.

In addition to \nnon-cancer\u2013related pain, differential diagnosis should include cancer recurrence or progressive disease. Consider referring to primary care \nservice for management of non-cancer pain.\n\u2022 Use a multimodality approach to pain management if those resources are available.\n\u2022  Non-opioid adjuvant analgesics are appropriate as primary therapy for many pain syndromes.\n\u2022  Non-pharmacologic interventions can be used as the sole treatment for pain, or as adjuncts to pharmacologic therapy.\n\u2022  Physical modalities (heat, cold, massage, acupuncture, physical therapy, or occupational therapy) are useful and should be considered for \nsome pain syndromes. \n\u2022 Opioid treatment is sometimes necessary, and the lowest appropriate dose should be used for the shortest amount of time possible.  \n\u2022  Psychological support of the survivor with chronic pain is necessary, and referral to psychosocial services should be considered for \nsurvivors in distress (SANXDE-1) .\n\u2022  Consider referral to a specialist for survivors who might benefit from further pain interventions. This could include referral to interventional \npain, physical medicine and rehabilitation, palliative care, pain specialist, urology, gynecology, orthopedic surgery, gastroenterology, or \nother appropriate consultants. \n\u0017If these resources are available, consider referral as early as possible during the course of treatment planning.\n\u2022 Opioids and pregnancy:\n\u0017Ensure appropriate opioid prescribing and screening for opioid use disorder (OUD) for survivors of childbearing potential. \n\u0017If a survivor on chronic opioids is pregnant or wants to become pregnant, do not stop opioids abruptly but coordinate further pain \nmanagement with the obstetrician. If the survivor has OUD and takes buprenorphine for addiction and/or pain, provide access to addiction \nservices without stopping buprenorphine. OUD can cause preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n\u2022 The panel acknowledges the legalization of medical marijuana for various conditions in multiple states. However, there are presently not \nenough data to make any guideline recommendations regarding use in cancer survivors.\n\u2022 Also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adult Cancer Pain.GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN MANAGEMENT", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9dfc5aa-92f4-4246-8b37-6dcc3d59576f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9dfc5aa-92f4-4246-8b37-6dcc3d59576f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ef9faa6-e139-4fe6-88e1-6fc7fb41ccda", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "450a83648da630f2b8b243931443339131b96e7d5e0c4b327c4b538bb3be0afa"}}, "hash": "450a83648da630f2b8b243931443339131b96e7d5e0c4b327c4b538bb3be0afa", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Cognitive Function\n\n\nSCF-3CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION INTERVENTIONS\nPatient/Family Education and Counseling\n\u2022 Validation of experience of cognitive dysfunction \nassociated with cancer diagnosis and treatment\n\u2022 Reassurance that cancer-associated cognitive \ndysfunction is often not a progressive neurologic \ndisorder like progressive dementiasb\n\u2022 Support self-management and coping strategiesGeneral Strategies for Management of Cancer- \nAssociated Cognitive Dysfunction\n\u2022 Teach enhanced organizational strategies (ie, \nusing memory aids like notebooks and planners, \nkeeping items in the same place, using reminder \nnotes, smart phone technology)\n\u2022 Encourage patients to do the most cognitively \ndemanding tasks at the time of day when energy \nlevels are highest\n\u2022 Provide information about relaxation or stress \nmanagement skills for daily use\n\u2022 Recommend routine physical activity (HL-1)\n\u2022 Recommend limiting use of alcohol and other \nagents that alter cognition and sleep\n\u2022 Consider meditation, yoga, mindfulness-based \nstress reduction, and cognitive training (ie, brain \ngames)\n\u2022 For older adults also see the cognitive function \nsection of the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult \nOncology (OAO-F)  \n\u2022 Optimize management of: \n\u0017Depression or emotional distress  \n(See appropriate survivorship guidelines or \nNCCN Guidelines for Distress Management)\n\u0017Sleep disturbance (SSD-1)\n\u0017Fatigue (SFAT-1)\n\u0017Contributing symptoms such as pain  \n(SPAIN-1)\n\u0017Medical comorbiditiesSee Specific Interventions \n(SCF-4)\nb Cognitive dysfunction may be progressive in survivors of CNS cancers or those who had CNS-directed therapies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bafa7706-bcfc-4bd1-86b1-ed7d49366810": {"__data__": {"id_": "bafa7706-bcfc-4bd1-86b1-ed7d49366810", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f563c50-9492-4666-b8c5-b8bdfa02f946", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "f62ed52cb80ca7242e72108cf8a288831fa8a0fee58b305f8c58dee326e0073a"}}, "hash": "f62ed52cb80ca7242e72108cf8a288831fa8a0fee58b305f8c58dee326e0073a", "text": "Food and supplements  Food goals\nSupplements\nNCCN experts advise that most cancer \nsurvivors do not take supplements.
