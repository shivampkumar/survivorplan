Several studies have shown that unemployment rates for \nsurvivors are higher than for the general population.87-90 Furthermore, \nthose survivors who do return to work often encounter difficulties, such as \nphysical or c ognitive limitations, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and \nperceived or real discrimination.87,91,92 \nSeveral studies  have addressed factors that predict a delayed return to \nwork.93-99 For example, a French p opulation -based study revealed that \nclinical factors, such as severity of the cancer, receipt of chemotherapy , or \nthe experience of adverse effec ts, were associated with a delay in return \nto work.97 In addition, a systematic review of cohort studies found that \nsurvivors who were o lder, had a lower educa tion level, or had a  lower \nincome  were less likely to return to work.98 Another systematic review \nidentified factors related to the person ( eg, symptoms, coping, motivation), \nenvironmental supports ( eg, family, workplace), and occupation ( eg, type \nof work, job flexibility)  that impacted successful return to work after cancer \ntreatment.100 \nSome interventions to enhance return -to-work in cancer survivors have \nbeen studied (eg, psycho -education , physical training, vocational \ncounseling ), although additional research in this area is greatly needed .101-\n104 Multidisciplinary interventions that combine vocational counseling with \nother elements (eg,  patient education, patient counseling, behavioral \ntraining , physical exercises ) may increase rates of  return -to-work \ncompared to usual care.  Financial Burden  \nThe LIVESTRONG 2012  Survey found that approximately 33% of working -\nage survivors went into debt and 3% had filed for bankruptcy.105 The ACS  \nStudy of Cancer Survivors II  found that 20% of survivors reported unmet \nfinancial needs.24 A study in Washington state found that patients with \ncancer have a 2.6 -fold increase d risk of bankruptcy.106 In another study, \n38% of patients with stage III colon cancer reported financial hardship  \nresulting from cancer treatment, defined as  accruing debt, selling or \nrefinancing  a home, borrow ing money from friends or family, or \nexperienc ing a \u226520% decline in annual income .107 Another study found \nthat, in addition to the average >$16,000 excess economic burden  that \npatients feel in th e early phases of cancer treatment, survivors (>1 year \nfrom diagnosis) have an average annual excess economic burden  that \nexceeds $4,000.108,109 Much of this excess burden was because of excess \nmedical expenditures. A more r ecent study found that the excess annual \nhealth  care expenditures of cancer survivors averaged about $4400, and \nthat the t otal mean annual direct health care expenditure for cancer \nsurvivors  increased by about $1000 in the period from 2009 to 2010 to the \nperiod from  2015  to 2016 .109 Other recent studies also found  that cancer \nsurvivors have greater out -of-pocket expenses and are more likely to \nexperience material hardship than those without a history of cancer.110,111 \nYounger cancer survivors seem to be particular ly vulnerable to the \nfinancial effects of cancer.111-113 \nClearly, with lost wages and increased expenses, the fin ancial burden on \nmany cancer survivors is great.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

At a minimum all survivors should be encouraged to:\n\u0017Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight throughout life (SNWM-2).\n\u0017Avoid inactivity.\n\u0017Engage in physical activity (eg, exercise, take the stairs, park in the back of parking lot) daily (SPA-1).\n\u0017Maintain a healthy diet high in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.\n\u0017Limit intake of red and cured meats and highly processed foods,a,b particularly those high in fats and sugars (SNWM-1).\n\u0017Drink alcohol sparingly if at all (SNWM-1). \n\u0017Discontinue use of cigarettes, other tobacco products (including hookah), and e-cigarettes (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation) .\n\u0017Practice sun safety\n \u25caUtilize a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 that protects against UVA and UVB rays and is water resistant.\n \u25caApply sunscreen generously and reapply every 2 hours or after swimming/excessive sweating.\n \u25caConsider using physical barriers whenever possible (ie, hats, shirts with sleeves, avoiding direct sun during peak hours).\n \u25caDo not use tanning beds.\n \u25caAvoid sunburns.\n \u25caSeek shade and wear protective clothing (ie, hats and long-sleeved garments) if outside for prolonged periods of time or during peak \ndirect sun hours.\n\u0017Strive for at least 7\u20139 hours of sleep on a regular basis (SSD-1).3\n \u25caYounger adults require more sleep.4\n \u25caTeenagers may require 9 or more hours of sleep.4\n\u0017Follow up with PCP regularly.\n \u25caAdhere to age-appropriate and treatment-associated health screening, preventive measures (SIMIN-1), and cancer screening \nrecommendations (NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, & Risk Reduction) .\n\u0017Obtain nutrients from food sources rather than relying on dietary supplements. Routine use of dietary supplements is not recommended \nfor the purposes of cancer control (SSUP-1).\n\u2022 A multidisciplinary approach (including but not limited to clinicians, physical therapists, dieticians, social workers, and patient navigators) \nshould be utilized to:\n\u0017Assess individual and community-level barriers to meeting the healthy lifestyle recommendations.\n\u0017Support patients in developing strategies to overcome challenges throughout the continuum of survivorship care (from diagnosis to long-\nterm survivorship). \n\u0017Consider specialty referrals to supportive programs offered by medical centers or the community (ie, Livestrong at the YMCA).\nFootnotes (HL-1A)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3701191a-df1d-4e41-a833-20925682fdfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "3701191a-df1d-4e41-a833-20925682fdfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87a993cb-11f2-4ea3-ab15-e637c96a8534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "82696164c74a4394161bbc03efc5ba71a20677143c6e7d6c2ddd829d8ef07321"}}, "hash": "82696164c74a4394161bbc03efc5ba71a20677143c6e7d6c2ddd829d8ef07321", "text": "STANDARDS FOR SURVIVORSHIP CAREb\nCare of the cancer survivor should include:\n1.

In addition, research focused \non patterns and quality of survivorship care  is lacking. A study of NIH \nsurvivorship grants in fiscal year 2016 showed a need for research \nincluding more diverse cancer types, older and longer -term survivors, and \nmore ethnoculturally diverse populations of survivors.181 \nIn June 2012, the ACS , CDC, LIVE STRONG  Foundation , and NCI held a \njoint meeting and created an action plan to facilitate the translation of \nsurvivorship research into survivorship care.182 The plan is driven by \ncollaboration between researchers, survivors, clinicians, and public health \nprofessionals; the use of technology, such as EHRs; analysis of \ninformation from the vie wpoints of multiple stakeholders; and the \nintegration and synthesis of knowledge using systematic reviews and \nmeta -analyses.  Recommendations for Preventive Health  \nAnalysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  \n(BRFSS)  indicates that a  large proportion of cancer survivors have \nsignificant comorbidities, smoke, are obese, and/or do not engage in \nphysical activity.183 Analysis of data from oth er studies, including the \nNational Health Interview Survey , showed similar results.184-187 Separate \nsurveys by the ACS and the CDC  found that 9.3% and 17% of survivors \nsmoke, respectively.186,188 In addition, many survivors forego \nrecommended cancer screenings (ie, co lorectal and cervical screening) \nand follow -up surveillance189-191 or demand more intense surveillance than \nevidence sup ports.84 \nHealthy Lifestyles  \nHealthy lifestyle habits, such as enga ging in routine physical activity, \nmaintaining a healthy diet and weight, and avoiding cigarette/ tobacco use, \nhave been associated with improved health outcomes and quality of life. \nFor some cancers, a healthy lifestyle has been associated with a reduced \nrisk of recurrence and death .192-199 In fact, the maintenance of a healthy \nlifestyle is associated with a decrease in premature death in cancer \nsurvivors.200 Therefore,  survivors should be encouraged to achieve and \nmaintain a healthy lifestyle , including  attention to weight management, \nphysical  activity, metabolic health, and dietary habits.  Setting incremental \ngoals for diet, physical activity, and weight management  should be \nadvised . Survivors should be counseled to limit alcohol intake and avoid or \nstop using cigarette/ tobacco products, with emphasis on tobacco \ncessation if the survivor is  a current smoker or user of smokeless tobacco \n(see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).201 Clinicians should also advise survivors to practice sun \nsafety habits  as appropriate, such as using a broad -spectrum sunscreen, \navoiding peak sun hours, and using physical barriers.

cancer treatment, or are in clinical remission. \n(Also see the NCCN Guidelines for Supportive Care )\n\u2022 These guidelines provide screening, evaluation, and treatment recommendations for common consequences of cancer and cancer treatment. They \ncan be used to optimize health and wellness for all survivors; however, they were created to assist health care professionals who work with survivors \nof adult-onset cancer in the post-treatment period, including those in both the oncology and primary care practices. \n\u2022 The panel recognizes that many of the post-treatment issues covered in these Guidelines are best addressed before cancer treatment begins so that \nmany problems can be prevented or minimized.\n\u2022 These guidelines are designed to provide a framework for the general survivorship care and management of potential long-term and/or late effects of \ncancer and its treatment that survivors may experience.\n\u2022 The NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship should be used as a supplement to the follow-up recommendations within the disease-specific guidelines. See \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site and NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care for recommendations regarding metastatic disease. \n\u2022 These guidelines, with the appropriate disease-specific guideline, provide a framework for the coordination of care between the survivor's health care \nproviders to ensure that needs are appropriately addressed.\n\u2022 The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be addressed at every visit. The panel recommends periodic screening assessments and \nappropriate follow-up care as clinically indicated. \n\u2022 Referral to other health care disciplines/providers or community resources may be used to address several indications or identified issues with one \nintervention (eg, rehabilitation for fatigue, depression, and pain).\n\u2022 The panel recommends stakeholders ensure the implementation of guideline-concordant survivorship care within their unique health \nsystems.1  Specifically, institutions are encouraged to determine how to systematically deliver the six key components of survivorship care \n(SURV-1).1-3 There are several models of care that frame the implementation of survivorship care according to provider type(s), clinic type(s), \npatient risk, and other factors.4-7 Engaging these models of care will facilitate implementation planning.7 Panel members recommend \ninstitutions provide the resources necessary to plan, deliver, and evaluate their survivorship care program(s).1-2\n\u2022 For survivorship issues related to younger populations, also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and the \nChildren's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers  \n(www.survivorshipguidelines.org).\n\u2022 For survivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune-mediated toxicities is warranted.

Although achieving all of these healthy lifestyle goals may be \ndifficult for many survivors, eve n small reductions in weight among \noverweight or obese survivors or small increases in physical activity \namong sedentary individuals are thought to yield meaningful \nimprovements in cancer -specific outcomes and overall health.202 Clinicians \nshould assess individual and  community -level barriers to meeting the \nhealthy lifestyle recommendations and support patients in developing \nstrategies to overcome challenges.  \nPhysical Activity  \nDuring cancer treatment, many survivors become deconditioned and can \ndevelop impaired cardiov ascular fitness because of the direct and \nsecondary effects of therapy.203 Randomized trials have shown that \nexercise training is safe, tolerable, and effective for most survivors. \nStructured aerobic and resistance training programs after treatment can \nimprove  cardiovascular fitness and strength and can have positive effects \non balance, body composition, fatigue, emotional well -being, and quality of \nlife.204-216 The effectiveness of exercise is especially well studied in \npatients  with early -stage breast cancer. Survivors of breast cancer who \nexercise have  improved cardiovascular fitness and therefore an increased \ncapacity to perform daily life functions, resulting in a better quality of \nlife.214,215,217 -219 Furthermore, a study of adult survivors of childhood \nHodgkin lymphoma  found that vigorous exercise was associated with a \nreduction in the risk of  major  cardiovascular  event s after a median follow -\nup of 11.9 years.220 In fact, the finding was dose -dependent, and survivors \nwho reported \u22659 metabolic equivalent (MET ) h/wk experienced a 51% \nreduction in risk compared with those reporting <9 MET h/wk (P = .002).  A similar study in patients with breast cancer found a similar reduction in the \nrisk of cardiovascular events  with \u22659 MET h/wk .221 \nIn addition, observational studies have consistentl y found that p hysical  \nactivity is linked to decreased cancer incidence and recurrence and \nincreased survival for certain tumor types.209,222 -239 For example, one meta -\nanalysis of 6 studies including more than 12,000 survivors of breast \ncancer found that post -diagnosis physical activity reduced all -cause \nmortality by 41% ( P < .00001)  and disease recurrence by 24% ( P = \n.00001).226 Data from other meta -analyses primarily consisting of \nobservational studies of survivors of colorectal, ovarian, non -small cell \nlung, brain, prostate, and breast cancers show that physical activity is \nassociated with decreased all -cause mortality and/or cancer -specific \nmortality.224,227,236,240 In fact, analyses of data from 986 survivors of breast \ncancer  from the National Ru nners' and Walkers' Health Studies  found that \nmortality decreased with increased rates of energy expenditure.237 \nEvidence in other disease sites is less robust, but also suggests survival \nbenefits associated with exercise in survivors after treatment.240 \nData also support the idea that inactivity/sedentary behavior is  a risk factor \nfor cancer incidence  and mortality and impacts mood and quality of life in \nsurvivors,  independent of the level of an individual\u2019s recreational or \noccupational physical activity.192,241 -247 For example, i n a cohort of more \nthan 2000 survivors of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, those who spent \nmore leisure time sitting had a higher  mortality than those who spent more \ntime in recreational activity.192 \nEvaluation

Your care provider will \nassess your level of distress and resources. \nIf you have a plan to do harm, your weapons \nwill be secured, you will be watched, and \nemergency services will be contacted. If you \nhave thoughts of death but no plans to hurt \nyourself, you will be referred for mental health \nservices. You must agree to call 911 or go the \nemergency department if you feel close to \ndoing harm.\nResources and referrals\nYour care provider can put you in touch with \nlocal resources. Based on your needs, you \nmay need help with practical problems, such \nas housing and food. You may benefit from \neducational and support groups. \nYour cancer or primary care provider may \nrefer you to a specialist. Specialists include \nchaplains, social workers, psychologists, \npsychiatrists, and advanced practice clinicians. \nChaplains can help you with religious or \nspiritual concerns. Social workers can help \nwith practical and psychosocial issues. Mental \nhealth providers can diagnose and provide \ntreatment for mental disorders.\nReview\n \u0086Distress is normal during cancer care. \nMany survivors have a normal fear of a \ncancer recurrence.\n \u0086Distress can lead to or worsen mental \ndisorders.

Disease and treatment considerations also \naffect recommendations for screening, such as the inclusion  of \nechocardiograms for patients who received cardiotoxic treatments and \nthyroid screening for patients who received radiation to the neck or thorax \nor agents such as immunotherapies or small molecule TKIs.  \nManagement of Fatigue  \nSeveral interventions and strategies have been shown to help alleviate \nfatigue and reduce distress caused by this symptom in patients with \ncancer and survivors; recommended strategies and interventions are \ndescribed herein. For additional information about fatigue in survivors and \npatients with cancer, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer -Related \nFatigue (available at www.NCCN.org ). These guidelines may be modified \nto fit the individual survivor\u2019s circumstance s. \nTreatment of Contributing Factors  \nManagement of fatigue in survivors first includes the treatment of \ncontributing factors such as pain, distress, anemia, and sleep disturbances \n(more information on  the treatment of pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep \ndisorders in survivors can be found throughout these guidelines). In a \nrandomized controlled trial of 152 fatigued patients with advanced cancer, \ntreatment of accompanying physical symptoms, including pain, nausea, \nvomiting, and shortness of breath, resulted  in a significantly higher impact \non general fatigue, activity, and motivation than usual care.692 \nPatient and Family Education and Counseling  \nEducation and counseling can be beneficial in helping patients cope with \nfatigue. Understanding typical patterns of fatigue during and after \ntreatment can help patients set reasonable expectations regarding \nimprovements in energy after the completion of can cer therapy and can \nhelp allay concerns that persistent fatigue after the completion of therapy \nis evidence of disease recurrence. Counseling can help patients develop \nstrategies for self -monitoring of fatigue and techniques such as energy conservation tha t may be helpful in the immediate post -treatment \nperiod.693 \nPhysical Activity  \nActivity en hancement is a category 1 recommendation for the \nmanagement of fatigue in survivors. Improving strength, energy, and \nfitness through regular exercise, even a moderate -intensity walking \nprogram, has been shown to facilitate the transition from patient to \nsurvivor, decrease anxiety and depression, improve body image, and \nincrease tolerance for physical activity. Therefore, survivors with moderate \nto severe fatigue should be encouraged to maintain adequate levels of \nphysical activity (category 1). Robust data support the efficacy of \nincreased physical activity for reducing fatigue in patients with cancer and \nsurvivors.204,210,215,217,219,560,694 -700 Multiple meta -analyses of randomized \ncontrolled trials have found that cancer survivors who participate in \nexercise interventions, either during or after treatment for cancer, \nexperience significant improvements in fatigue com pared with patients \nrandomized to the control group.204,700 -703 A randomized phase 3 trial that \nincluded 410 cancer survivors showed that a 4-week yoga therapy \nprogra m led to impro vements in fatigue and sleep quality and reductions in \ndaytime dysfunction .704 \nSurvivors at a higher risk of injury should be referred to a physical \ntherapist or exercise specialist (also see Healthy Lifestyles , above ). \nPsychosocial and Other Interventions  \nPsychosocial int erventions, such as CBT, MBSR, psycho -educational \ntherapy, and supportive expressive therapy, including support groups, \ncounseling, and journal writing (all category 1 recommendations), have \nalso been shown to reduce fatigue in cancer survivors, although d ata are \nnot entirely consistent.567,705 -710 Several meta -analyses have evaluated the \nrole of psychosocial interventions in reducing fatigue.700,705,709,711 For", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2766a355-6c09-4468-b0f8-608e1a9e9c44": {"__data__": {"id_": "2766a355-6c09-4468-b0f8-608e1a9e9c44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f919a48-4f77-4dd7-a1de-aa244a1dbfab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "6de3458d2cb32728fcd7bfa0fbd4d8ee9b7ae5796e8d47b9778a817655fcde1b"}}, "hash": "6de3458d2cb32728fcd7bfa0fbd4d8ee9b7ae5796e8d47b9778a817655fcde1b", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-11 Assessment for Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment  \nAll survivors should be assessed at least annually for symptoms related to \ncancer and prior cancer treatment, with appropriate follow -up care as \nclinically indicated. This assessment can be done by the oncologist or \nPCP. Shared , coordinated care between the oncology , primary care , and \nsubspecialty care  provider s is encouraged.  Depending on the cancer type \nand stage of disease, transition of care to primary care may be done when \ndeemed clinically appropriate, with referral back to oncologic care as \nneeded. The panel does not assume that all survivorship issues will be \naddressed at every visit.  \nSome tools that screen for long -term and late physical and psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment in survivors  have been validated.171-176 \nIn addition, the NCCN Survivorship Panel  created a sample screening \ninstrument  that is guideline -specific and can be self-administered or \nadministered by an interviewer . This assessment tool was developed \nspecifically for use in co mbination with the NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship to help providers deliver necessary and comprehensive \nsurvivorship care. Although this instrument has not yet been piloted or \nvalidated, t he answers can be used to guide  providers to  topics within the \nguidelines that require  more in -depth assessment  via validated tools \nand/or clinical evaluation.  \nIn addition  to screening by history and physical examination , care \nproviders should assess the following  at regular intervals:  \n1. Current disease status  \n2. Functional/p erformance status  \n3. Medication use ( including over -the-counter medications and \nsupplements ) \n4. Comorbidities  \n5. Prior cancer treatment history and modalities used  \n6. Family history  7. Psychosocial factors  \n8. Weight and health behaviors that can modify cancer and \ncomorbidity risk (including cigarette/tobacco, alcohol use)  \n9. Disease -specific recommendations for surveillance/follow -up (see \nNCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site , at \nwww.NCCN.org )  \n \nThis information can also inform about the patient\u2019s risk for specific late or \nlong-term effects, including risks for subsequent primary cancers and \ncomorbidities. For examp le, patients w ho received pelvic irradiation or \nsurgery are at risk for sexual dysfunction; patients with a history of brain \nmetastasis or cranial irradiation have an elevated  risk for cognitive \ndysfunction. In general, those who underwent more intensive t herapy are \nat higher risk for multiple late and/or long -term effects. Survivors \nundergoing certain treatments, such as mantle field radiation or certain \nsystemic therapies, may be at increased risk for subsequent malignancies. \nThose survivors who continue to smoke are at increased risk for smoking -\nrelated comorbidities and subsequent primary cancers.  \nReassessment  \nSurvivors should be followed and reassessed at regular intervals, \ndepending on the nature and severity of late and long -term effects being \ntreated . At each time point, assessment of disease status and ongoing \neffects of cancer and its treatment should be addressed. In addition, \nsurvivors should be periodically rescreened for the development of new \nlate and long -term effects of cancer and its treatme nt. The outcomes of \nany interventions for ongoing effects of cancer and its treatment should be \nevaluated regularly based on best practices and available resources. \nOutcome assessment may include survivor satisfaction with the \neffectiveness of the interven tion in reducing symptom burden, adequate \npain control, receipt of recommended immunizations and preventive care,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "feb649f0-d54d-4faa-9b66-e9c6539a7134": {"__data__": {"id_": "feb649f0-d54d-4faa-9b66-e9c6539a7134", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dbb3fa02-405c-4d6e-8877-9b050354b6ad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "f48a89bdc290665ecbe45e6314ef76ec76a34099b1b0f28595c6d8f974442a8f"}}, "hash": "f48a89bdc290665ecbe45e6314ef76ec76a34099b1b0f28595c6d8f974442a8f", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-3 evidence is  lacking are based on the panel\u2019s review of lower -level \nevidence and expert opinion.  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available on the NCCN website  (www.NCCN.org ). \nGeneral Principles of These Guidelines  \nThese NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship provide screening, evaluation, \nand treatment recommendations for common consequenc es of cancer and \ncancer treatment to aid health care professionals  who work with survivors \nof adult -onset  cancer, including those in specialty cancer survivor clinics \nand primary care practices. These guidelines are focused on options to \nmaintain and enhan ce wellness in cancer survivors who are receiving or \nhave completed active therapy, including  those receiving treatment for \nyears, those who may be in remission, and those who are cured. These \nguidelines are designed to provide a framework for the manageme nt of \nlong-term and/or late effects of cancer and its treatment. T he guidelines \nfocus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment \nof cancer can have on the adult survivor's  health,  physical and mental  \nstates, health behaviors, professional and personal identity, sexuality , and \nfinancial standing . \nThe panel acknowledges  that there is a growing population of cancer \nsurvivors with chronic cancer. This group includes those with incurable \ndisease who are receiving  systemic therapy  continuously  and those  who \nmay be  on treatment  intermittently. Although these guidelines do not \naddress the specific needs of survivors with chronic cancer (eg, \npsychosocial issues related to living for years with a terminal diagnosis \nand u ncertainty about the future; how to handle comorbid conditions and \ndisease prevention, screening, and treatment in the setting of limited life \nexpectancy; managing discussions around new drugs and early -stage \nclinical trials ),15 many of the recommendations in these guidelines are relevant to this population (eg, those around fatigue, anxiety, depression ). \nThe panel emphasizes that these guidelines may be used to guide the \nmanagement of all cancer survivors \u2013 not just those who have completed \ntreatment, but also the population with chronic cancer.  \nThese guidelines  should be used as a supplement to the follow -up \nrecommendations within the disease -specific guidelines (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site, available at www.NCCN.org ) \nand should provide a framework for the coordination of care between the \nsurvivor\u2019s health care providers to ensure that needs are appropriately \naddressed.  \nThese guidelines are not intended to provide guidance for the care of \nsurvivors of childhood cancer (detailed guidelines for the care of childhood \ncancer survivors are available from the Children\u2019s Oncology Group at \nhttp://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/ ). For survivorship issues related to \nyounger populations,  please also see the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent \nand Young Adult  (AYA) Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org ). For \nsurvivors treated with immunotherapy, ongoing surveillance for immune -\nmediated toxicities is warranted (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nManagement of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nFor this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Surv ivorship, the panel \nfocused on the preventive health issues including healthy lifestyle \nbehaviors, immunizations and prevention of infection, and cardiovascular \ndisease (CVD) risk assessment and modification . The panel also focused \non several common issues  of survivors: 1) anthracycline -induced cardiac \ntoxicity; 2) anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress; 3) cognitive decline; \n4) fatigue; 5) lymphedema; 6) hormone -related symptoms; 7) pain; 8) \nfemale and male sexual dysfunction;  and 9)  sleep disorders.

cancers.59-62 Studies by individual cancer type show that the \nincidence of subsequent unrelated cancers ranges from 2% in survivors of \nmalignant lymphoma to 30% in survivors of small cell  lung cancer  \n(SCLC) .26 Another study of more than  2 million cancer survivors in the \nSEER database i dentified the highest risk for subsequent primary cancers \nin survivors of bladder cancer (34% at 20 years).63 Overall, this study \nfound that 8.1% of survivors of cancers diagnosed after age 18 years \ndevelop a subsequent malignancy within a mean follow -up of 7.1 years, \nwith 55% of these survivors dying as a res ult of the subsequent cancer.  \nScreening for subsequent primary cancers should be a shared \nresponsibility between primary and oncology care physicians (see the \nNCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, & Risk Reduction, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). In addition, lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of \nsubsequent primary cancers (eg, smoking cessation, physical activity, \nweight loss) should be encouraged.64 Finally, referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates, such as those with a cancer diagnosis at a young age or with \nmultiple primary cancers , to identify those with a potential increased risk  \nfor subsequent malignancies.65 Family cancer history should be \nperiodically updated to reassess hereditary risk, because it should not be \nassumed that all cancer survivors were assessed at diagnosis. Gen etic \ntesting guidelines and knowledge about hereditary cancer risk evolve over \ntime, and new family diagnoses may occur making periodic assessment \nimportant . Genetic risk assessment is appropriate for all survivors  of \nbreast cancer , epithelial ovarian cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, \npancreatic cancer, and colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed at age \n50 years or younger. Many other survivors of rare cancers, cancers \ndiagnosed at young ages, multiple primary cancers, or those  with one or \nmore relatives with the same or related cancers are also candidates for \nrisk assessment per guidelines from NCCN and other expert groups. Genetic counseling and testing is recommended for appropriate survivors \nbased on results of the risk asse ssment. Referral to genetic risk \nassessment and/or testing should be considered for appropriate \ncandidates when available to identify those with an increased risk for \nsubsequent malignancies. Genetic testing may also provide opportunities \nto identify and r educe risks in relatives of cancer survivors. Several NCCN \nGuidelines (available at www.NCCN.org ) include criteria for genetic ris k \nassessment and testing, and management recommendations for patients \nwith known germline mutations linked to an increased risk for cancer, as \nlisted above in these guidelines.  \nPsychosocial Effects  \nCancer can have positive effects on a significant portion of individuals, \nincluding strengthened relationships, a s ense of gratitude or \nempowerment, and an increased appreciation for life.66-72 Many survivors, \nhowever, experience p sychologic distress  after active treatment, and \nsome experience a combination of positive and ne gative psychologic \neffects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "377cbad5-d356-42f9-af1c-e0f22f270635": {"__data__": {"id_": "377cbad5-d356-42f9-af1c-e0f22f270635", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fee636d6-f5b4-48de-ad73-37c3b73903af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "60e30b4d15d8e7a630bf2aecd5cd1e7819d18d57a74f4b4bd06f59dafa53c9bb"}}, "hash": "60e30b4d15d8e7a630bf2aecd5cd1e7819d18d57a74f4b4bd06f59dafa53c9bb", "text": "Food and supplements  Review\nReview\n \u0086Cancer survivors are at risk for not eating \nthe foods they need.\n \u0086Nutrients are substances in food that the \nbody uses to live.

The panel recognizes that not all individuals with a history of cancer identify with the term \"survivor.\" These guidelines \nare meant to be inclusive and use the term \"survivor\" to describe anyone with a history of cancer.\n\u2022 These guidelines focus on the vast and persistent impact both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer have on the adult survivor. This \nincludes the potential impact on physical and mental states, health behaviors, professional and personal identity , sexuality, and financial \nstanding. It is appropriate to counsel on these impacts early in the treatment trajectory and at regular intervals thereafter.\n\u2022 These guidelines are applicable to survivors across the continuum of care, including those on prolonged therapy, those with chronic \ncancers (eg, metastatic disease), and long-term survivors.\n\u2022 The panel recognizes the growing population of individuals who are living with metastatic disease and that many aspects of these guidelines \npertain to this population of survivors. This group is included in the definition of survivorship, and these guidelines are meant to be applied \nwhen helpful to meet the individuals' needs. \n\u2022 The panel recommends reviewing the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship in conjunction with the cancer-specific guidelines for individuals \nwith metastatic disease. As more evidence is established for this population, more specific survivorship guidelines for individuals living with \nmetastatic cancers may be developed..\n\n\n\n\nSURV-1", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c26d125-9841-43ec-b7b3-3e51a09ced8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c26d125-9841-43ec-b7b3-3e51a09ced8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "78ffb354-2366-42d7-bc6e-ab1be60aa09a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "2919647c04d52cf1a323408044d29fb4a22701dba5cdc79d722827c251723393"}}, "hash": "2919647c04d52cf1a323408044d29fb4a22701dba5cdc79d722827c251723393", "text": "Physical activity  Tips for achieving goals\n 2 Physical activity  Tips for achieving goals | Review\nTips for achieving goals\nPhysical activity is a life-long pursuit.

There are many types of survivors, including those living with cancer \nand those fr ee of cancer. This term is meant to capture a population of \nthose with a history of cancer rather than to provide a label that ma y or \nmay not resonate with individuals .\u201d16  \nThe Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment  \nFor some survivors, the consequences of cancer are minimal; these \npatients can return to a normal life after the completion of treatment. In \nfact, most cancer survivors rep ort being in good general health and \nexperience good to excellent quality of life.17,18 Also, a survey of 659 \nsurvivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers  found that a majority \ndo not suffer from psychologic morbidity or have a large number of unmet \nsupportive care need s.19,20 Other studies have similarly found that most \nsurvivors enjoy a high quality of life without a large number of cancer -\nrelated symptoms.21,22 \nHowever, many survivors do experience physical and/or psychosocial \neffects of cancer and its treatment.23-25 Some sequelae become evident \nduring anticancer treatment (long -term effects), whereas others may not \nmanifest for months or years after active therapy (late effects).  The \nproblems can range from mild to severe,  debilitating, or even life -\nthreatening. Some problems are temporary or improve with time, whereas \nother problems are progressive or permanent. This topic has been well \nreviewed.18,26 \nA literature review suggests that at least 50% of survivors experience \nsome late effect s of cancer treatment.26 The most common problems in \ncancer survivors are depression , pain, and fat igue.27 The exact prevalence of various effects of cancer and its treatment are hard to quantify, because \nfew studies have addressed these issues in a longitudinal fashion, \ncomparing patients with and without a histo ry of cancer to differentiate \nbetween the effects of cancer and the effects of aging.18 In general, the \nprevalence of late effects in cancer survivo rs is believed to have increased \nover time, likely because anticancer interventions have become more \ncomplex and intense with combinations of surgery, radiation, \nchemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted biologics.28 \nPhysical Effects  \nPhysical effects of cancer and its treatment in cancer survivors include \npain, muscu loskeletal issues, fatigue, lack of stamina, urinary and bowel \nproblems , lymphedema , premature menopause, cognitive deficits, \ndiabetes, and sexual dysfunction.18,29 -32 The effects of cancer treatment on \nthe heart and bone

surveys have reported that 35% to 40% of survivors receive a \nwritten follow -up care plan and/or a written treatment summary.162,163 \nASCO released a clinical expert statement on cancer survivorship care \nplanning  in 2014.164 The group of experts identified barriers to the \nsuccessful implementation of survivorship care planning (including the \ntime it takes to complete one , the lack of reimbursement for doing so, and \nthe uncertainty as to whose responsibility it is to prepare the plan) and \nrevised the ASCO survivorship care plan template to help address some \nof these barriers. In addition, a pilot study asses sed the use of electronic \nhealth records (EHRs) to reduce the time and effort involved with creating \ncare plans.165 Although many plan elements required manual entry by the \noncologist, the median time to complete the plans was only 3 minutes \n(range 2 \u201312 minutes ). Another group reported on a similar initiative to \nfacilitate genera tion of care plans using EHRs.166 Care plan creation took a \nmean 12 minutes (range 10 \u201315 minutes). However, a study in which EHR -\nbased treatment summaries were abstracted and cross -checked revealed \nthat 30% contained \u22651 omissions , and 10% contained \u22651 errors, indicating \nthat autopopulatio n systems will require manual double -checking to \nensure accuracy.167 Thus, providing a survivorship care plan is time -\nconsuming and resource -intensive and could have unforeseen \nharms.154,168 \nBecause definitive evidence that survivorship care plans improve \noutcomes is lacking, the NCCN Survivo rship Panel currently recommends \nplanning for ongoing survivorship care, but does not mandate the use of \nsurvivorship care  plans . The plan ning should include:  \n\u2022 Information on treatment received including all surgeries, radiation \ntherapy, and systemic therap ies \n\u2022 Information regarding follow -up care , surveillance, and screening \nrecommendations  \u2022 Information on post -treatment needs, including information \nregarding acute, late and long -term treatment -related effects , and \nhealth risks when possible (See NCCN Guidelines  for Treatment of \nCancer by Site ) \n\u2022 Delineation regarding roles of oncologists, PCP s, and subspecialty \ncare physicians in long-term care and timing of transfer of care if \nappropriate  \n\u2022 Healthy behavior recommendations  \n\u2022 Periodic  assessment of ongoing needs and identification of \nappropriate resources  \nData from o ngoing trials will help inform future recommendations . \nSurveillance fo r Cancer Recurrence  \nScreening for cancer recurrence is an important aspect of survivorship \ncare. In general, this surveillance is performed by the oncology team. \nWhen surveillance is overseen by the primary care team, the oncologist \nshould provide evidence -based recommendations based on currently \navailable guidelines. Specific recommendations for surveillance testing \nvary between cancer site and stage and individualized patient risk and are \nnot addressed in these guidelines. Please see individual NCCN Guide lines \nfor Treatment of Cancer by Site (available online at www.NCCN.org ) for \ndisease -specific surveillance recommendations. Additional lab work, \nimaging studies, or other studies to eval uate for recurrence should be \nbased on clinical presentation and judgment. The use of radiologic \nimaging studies (ie, CT) should be based on evidence that early detection \nof recurrence will improve cancer -related outcomes, because evidence \nsuggests that ex cess radiation exposure associated with CT imaging may \nbe associated with an increased risk of developing a radiation -associated \ncancer.169,170", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "913e2f59-7497-4d87-9a74-90f56be8c656": {"__data__": {"id_": "913e2f59-7497-4d87-9a74-90f56be8c656", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35077324-7532-4e1a-9fe0-223cb6970796", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "05da385242eb270fe677aaf289612c549ee8b425cb1d42d7cff8d9d5c9d84d34"}}, "hash": "05da385242eb270fe677aaf289612c549ee8b425cb1d42d7cff8d9d5c9d84d34", "text": ".\n\n\n\nSurvivorship: Physical Activity\n\n\nSPA-1a Additional resources for physical activity in cancer survivors:\n\u2022 Rock CL, Thomson CA, Sullivan KR, et al.

Referral to mental health servi ces \nmay include  a psychiatrist, psychologist, advanced practice c linicians, \nand/or social worker,  or management with oncology or primary  care \nsupport and online, telephone -based, or community support resources. \nTherapists with psycho -oncology training are preferred if available; \ntherefore, distance -based methods may be needed for those without \nresources in their communities.  \nFor additional information regarding anxiety, depression, and distress in \npatients with cancer, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Di stress \nManagement (available at www.NCCN.org ).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6776ca98-049e-46aa-a585-9ea6bd52fdb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "6776ca98-049e-46aa-a585-9ea6bd52fdb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18f0d533-8159-41e3-8840-95cbe600eab5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "47019a10863900bfd119bd912177944af757180870dc51bab27450de848cf269"}, "2": {"node_id": "06980ec3-4230-4ba4-b4d0-f4d3afb62e4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "f823221ef53e2ef0056db8272a22282d135306cfeb0c16b79144ec61a7dfc436"}}, "hash": "6a2b4dd01551ef5a0717125ee5dd713eccd17cf7efac88be1e69fa76f83c403b", "text": "The NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship complement the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management.  \nThese guidelines may be modified to accommodate  the individual \ncircumstances  of cancer survivors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23811190-3dff-44ac-99eb-5ccf1a05d9cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "23811190-3dff-44ac-99eb-5ccf1a05d9cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1f81d86-a07d-4992-b7b8-5e61d64430ca", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "8ec27f840d11cf39eb151c803fda2febf314c3d694e05682b466809feab80ee4"}}, "hash": "8ec27f840d11cf39eb151c803fda2febf314c3d694e05682b466809feab80ee4", "text": ",     \nSurvivorship  \n \nMS-15 considered the physical activity guidelines for Americans published by the \nDepartment of Health and Human  Services (HHS)  and those on diet and \nphysical activity for the preve ntion of cancer by the ACS .262,263 The panel \nsupports the recommendations by these groups and has adapted them as \nfollows : \n1. Physical activity and exercise recommendations should be tailored to \nindividual survivors\u2019 abilities and preferences.  \n2. Survivors who are able should be encouraged to engage in daily \nphysical activity , including exercise, routine activities, and \nrecreation al activities .  \n3. All survivors should be encouraged to limit sedentary behavior (eg, \nsitting for long periods)  and return to daily activities as soon as \npossible.  \n4. Physical activity for cancer survivors:  \n\u2022 Overall volume of weekly activity should be at least  150 to 300 \nminutes of moderate -intensity activity or 75 minutes of \nvigorous -intensity activity, or an equivalent combination spread \nout over the course of the we ek; \n\u2022 Individuals should engage in 2 to 3 sessions per week of \nstrength training (see Resistance T raining , below) that include \nmajor muscle groups; and  \n\u2022 Major muscle groups should be stretched at least 2 days per \nweek  on days that other exercises are performed .  \n \nThe panel acknowledges that m ost survivors do not meet  these exercise \nrecommendations , and a significant portion reports that they perform no \nleisure -time activity.183,264 However, the evidence suggests that ev en light -\nintensity physical activity can improve physical functioning in survivors.265 \nFor survivors who are inactive, clinicians should not advise the immediate \ninitiation of a high -intensity, hig h-frequency program.266,267 Instead, the \npanel suggests that clinicians provide sufficient information to encourage \nsurvivors to avoid a sedentary lifestyle .253 Survivors and providers should work together to address barriers to physical activity and develop \nincremental short - and long -term physical activity goals. These goals may \ninclude increment al increases in time spent in physical activity or in \nintensity of activity over time. The panel suggested a possible initial \nphysical activity prescription (starting inactive survivors with 1 to 3 light -\n/moderate -intensity sessions of 20 minutes or more p er week), with \nprogression based on tolerance.266 For survivors tolerating the minimum \nguideline recommendations, clinicians should consider encouraging  \nincremental increases in time spent in physical activity or in intensity of \nactivity . Walking and using a s tationary bike are safe for virtually all \nsurvivors.  \nResistance Training  \nThe health benefits of resistance training include improvement in muscle \nstrength and endurance, improvements in functional status, and \nmaintenance/improvement in bone density. Core and strength training is \nimportant to maintain balance and minimize fall r isk. Studies in survivors \nhave shown improvements in lean body mass, muscular function, and \nupper body strength, and a slowing of physical function deterioration .268-273 \nA recent systematic review of 15 studies of r esistance training \ninterventions during and /or after cancer treatment  concluded that \nmeaningful improvements in physiologic and quality -of-life outcomes can \nbe achieved.270 A similar review of 11 randomized controlled trials came to \nsimilar conclusions.273 One recent study that included 2863 cancer \nsurvivors  found resistance exercise to be associated  with a 33% lower risk \nof all -cause mortality (95% CI, 0.45 \u20130.99) , independent of aerobic \nexercise.274 \nAll major muscle groups (chest, shoulders, arms, back, core, and legs) \nshould be incorporated into a resistance training program.

Prevention of new and recurrent  cancers and other late effects  \n2. Surveillance for cancer spread , recurrence, or subsequent cancers  \n3. Assessment of late psychosocial , physical , and immunologic \neffects   \n4. Intervention for consequences of cancer and treatment ( eg, \nmedical problems, symptoms, psy chologic distress,  financial and \nsocial concerns)  \n5. Coordination of care between primary care providers and \nspecialists to ensure that all of the survivor\u2019s health needs are met  \n6.

Cancer survivors with \nuntreated distress have poorer compliance with surveillance screenings \nand are less likely to exercise and quit smoking.120 A 2008 IOM report, \n\u201cCancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health \nNeeds, \u201d121 concluded that psychosocial screening and care should be a \npart of the new standard for quality cancer care and should be integrated \ninto routine care across the trajectory of cancer, which inc ludes the period \nafter active treatment . See the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management \n(available at www.NCCN.org ) and Anxiety and Depression  below for \nrecommendations on screening for and treating distress.  \nIn September  2011, the LIVESTRONG Foundation convened a meeting of \nexperts and stakeholders in the survivorshi p field to define essential elements of survivorship care.  After 2 days of consensus building, the \ngroup agreed on the following elements that all medical settings must \nprovide for cancer survivors, either directly or through referral \n(http://images.livestrong.org/downloads/flatfiles/what -we-do/our -\napproach/reports/ee/EssentialElementsBrief.pdf ): \n1. Survivorship care plan, psychosocial care plan, and treatment \nsummary  \n2. Screening for new cancers and surveillance for recurrence  \n3.

However, discussions about work are ideally best had before treatment begins so that treatment recommendations \ncan take work needs into consideration if possible. \n\u2022 Symptoms affecting work may wax and wane with a survivor\u2019s treatments or disease status, especially if they are living chronically with \ncancer or the consequences of cancer treatment. Some survivors might start and stop working more than once.\n\u2022 Most existing literature focuses on unemployment and/or those who do not return to work. However, underemployment and/or work \nlimitations due to cancer or side effects are also common.\n\u2022 Employment helps to protect survivors from financial toxicity and, at least in the United States, is frequently tied to health insurance access. \nThis can be a main reason survivors work even when/if they are not fully recovered.\n\u2022 Employment is an important source of personal interaction, normalcy , and social support. The psychosocial effects/advantages derived from \nwork may include a sense of purpose, emotional well-being, link to identity , improved quality of life, connection with others, and distraction.\n\u2022 Some populations are at increased risk for difficulties related to work (based on factors such as gender , age, race, ethnicity, cancer type, \ncancer stage, rural residence, educational attainment, etc). The increased difficulties in these populations are more likely for survivors \nwith physically or cognitively demanding jobs or jobs with limited flexibility in scheduling or tasks. Additionally, patients with cancer may \nexperience discrimination as a result of diagnosis/illness, and this may be a consideration for some individuals in decisions surrounding \nemployment.\n\u2022 Survivors should be offered information to help them understand their likely ability to work, take into account their finances and personal/\nfamily needs, and discuss potential work accommodations with their employers.1 \n\u2022 Clinicians should regularly re-evaluate work-related concerns post active cancer treatment or for persons living chronically with cancer .\n\u0017Periodically identify goals and barriers regarding work with survivor  (SWORK-3).\n\u0017A team approach may be needed. Consider early involvement of social work, primary care, physical therapy/occupational therapy, cancer \nrehabilitation, and/or career counseling services, if available.\n\u0017Employment disability forms are not typically well-suited to cancer . However, clinicians should consider the survivor\u2019s needs for flexibility \nin tasks and hours, and other workplace accommodations as a starting point for filling out the necessary forms.

This increased risk is due to genetic susceptibilities (eg, \nhereditary cancer syndromes) and/or family history, shared etiologic exposures (eg, smoking, environmental exposures, health behaviors, \nhuman papillomavirus [HPV]), and mutagenic effects of cancer treatment. Health behaviors should be modified as possible (eg, smoking \ncessation, weight management) to decrease the risk of subsequent malignancies.\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyle and behavioral counseling are important to reduce risk factors that may contribute to subsequent cancers (HL-1).\n\u2022 Treatment-related subsequent primary cancers vary with the type and intensity of anticancer treatment and are associated in particular with \nRT and specific chemotherapeutic agents. For recommendations for screening considerations, s ee Principles of Screening for Treatment-\nRelated Subsequent Primary Cancers (SURV-C).\n\u2022 Screening for subsequent primary cancers should be a shared responsibility between primary and oncology care physicians. For survivors \nliving with metastatic disease, recommendations for screening should be tailored to the survivor's individualized risk and disease status.  \n(See the NCCN Guidelines for Detection, Prevention, and Risk Reduction  ). \n\u2022 Evidence suggests that excess lifetime radiation exposure from CT imaging may be associated with a mildly increased risk of developing a \nradiation-associated cancer.

Disease Risk Assessment\nSCVD-1PRINCIPLES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK ASSESSMENT\n\u2022 CVD remains a leading cause of death in cancer survivors. CVD-related comorbidity and mortality may detrimentally affect patients with \ncancer and survivors with short- and long-term sequelae. Counseling regarding cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle modifications are \nparamount in cancer survivors and patients with favorable prognoses. The risk of CVD-related death varies with years from diagnosis, with \nmost survivors being at greatest risk 5 or more years after diagnosis and completion of curative therapy.\n\u2022 Referral to a cardiologist or cardio-oncologist in patients at elevated CVD risk should be considered at any stage of the cancer journey .\n\u2022 Shared risk factors for both cancer and CVD (ie, smoking, poor health behaviors) contribute to the development of CVD and structural heart \ndisease or heart failure, a concept that becomes especially relevant to cancer survivors. Attention and counseling regarding shared risk \nfactors may improve cancer- and cardiovascular-related outcomes.\n\u2022 Cancer treatments (immunotherapy,a cytotoxic and targeted systemic therapies,b RT) can result in diverse cardiovascular issues, including \ncardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis after head and neck and mantle \nradiation, and cerebrovascular accidents.\n\u0017Survivors treated with anthracyclines are at increased risk for heart failure (SCARDIO-1).\n\u0017Androgen or estrogen deprivation therapy may elevate cardiovascular risk.c\n\u2022 Most CVDs (such as atherosclerosis) develop over time as a result of well-defined risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, use of \ntobacco products, obesity, and diabetes. Control of these risk factors can decrease the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. \n\u2022 Survivors should be assessed throughout the survivorship continuum for:\n\u0017Pre-existing and emerging CVD (eg, CAD, CHF, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation) and CVD risk factors \n(eg, hypertension, dislipidemia, obesity, cigarette/tobacco use, diabetes mellitus), with intervention for modifiable risk factors as necessary\n\u0017Cancer treatment history (eg, regimen/dose,b radiation field, dose/volume)\n\u0017Diet and exercise habits\n\u2022 Tools exist to help quantify atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk (eg, ASCVD risk scored).\n\u2022 Survivors should be counseled on any increased risk of CVD they may have based on prior treatment, comorbidity, or CVD risk factors and \non the ABCDEs of CVD Prevention (see Table 1 on SCVD-2).\n\u2022 Cooperation and shared care with primary care providers, and cardiovascular specialists as needed, is key to optimizing cardiac and \nvascular outcomes in cancer survivors. \n\u2022 Consider referral to cardio-oncology or a cardiology specialist for high-risk survivors.e\na Drobni ZD, Alvi RM, Taron J, et al.

In fact, antibody titers to vaccine -preventable diseases \ndecrease after anti -cancer treatment.399,400 In addition, survivors are at \nincreased risk of complications from vaccine -preventable diseases, such \nas those caused by HPV and influenza viruses.400,401  \nMany infections in survivors can be prevented by the use of vaccines. \nHowever, data from the BRFSS found that 42% of survivors did not \nreceive an influenza vaccinati on in 2009, and 52% reported never \nreceiving a pneumococcal vaccination.183 Analysis of the SEER -Medicare \ndatabase showed that survivors  of breast cancer, aged  \u226565 years, were \nless likely to receive an influenza vaccination than matched non -cancer \ncontrols.141 A separate analysis of the SEER -Medicare database by \nanother group found similar results.402 \nVaccines represent a unique challenge in cancer and transplant survivors, \nbecause they may or may not trigger the desired protective immune \nresponses due to possible residual immune deficits.403-405 In addition, certain vaccines, such as those that are live attenuated (eg, zoster [ZVL, \nMMRV, or VAR]; MMR), are contraindicated in active ly \nimmunosuppressed survivors because of an increased risk of developing \nthe disease and/or prolonged shedding of the live organism given in the \nvaccine.  \nRisk Assessment and Screening for Immunizations and Prevention of \nInfections  \nSurvivors are at elevated risk for infections if their cancer treatment \nincluded chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab, \nalemtuzumab), radiation, corticosteroids, splenectomy,  CAR T -cell \ntherapy , and/or HCT (which includes peripheral blood stem cell \ntransplanta tion, bone marrow transplantation, and cord blood \ntransplantation). Risk is also elevated if the survivor has prior or current \nexposure to endemic infections or epidemics, or has a history of blood \ntransfusion.  \nInterventions for Prevention of Infections  \nInfection in survivors can be prevented by education, antimicrobial \nprophylaxis, and the judicious use of vaccines. For information regarding \nantimicrobial prophylaxis, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Prevention \nand Treatment of Cancer -Related Infections (available online at \nwww.NCCN.org ). \nEducation  \nSurvivors should be educated about safe pet care, the avoidance of \nzoonosis, travel precautions, gardening precautions , proper hand hygiene , \nand avoidance of respiratory droplets  during a respiratory virus \npandemic .406-413 Contact with pets did not increase the risk of fever, \nbacteremia, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis in children with acute myeloid \nleukemia  (AML) ,414 and the panel believes that contact with pets is \ngenerally safe for most survivors.

Common barriers include not having enough time \nto exercise, not hav ing access to an acceptable exercise environment, \nuncertainty about safety of exercise post -treatment, lack of knowledge \nregarding appropriate activities, and physical limitations.250 Alleviation of \npain, fatigue, distress, or nutritional deficits can facilitate the initiation of an \nexercise program.  \nRisk Assessment for Exercise -Induced Adverse Events  \nExercise is considered safe for most survivors .214,215,251 However, a \nsignificant portion of survivors may have comorbid conditions or risk \nfactors that make them unable to safely exercise without trained \nsupervision.252 Therefore, a risk assessment is required for all survivors \nbefore prescribing a specific exercise program.214,253 The type of cancer, \ntreatment modalities received, and the number and severity of \ncomorbidities determine risk levels.251 Thus, disease and treatment \nhistory, late and long -term effects, and comorbidities should be assessed. \nA standardized pre-participa tion screening questionnaire, such as the \nPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone  (PAR-Q+),254 can \nalso be considered to identify patients for whom unsupervised physical \nactivity is likely safe versus those for whom it may pose undue risk.  \nSurvivors with peripheral neuropathy, poor bone health, a rthritis , or \nmusculoskeletal issues  are considered to be at moderate risk for exercise -\ninduced adverse events. Stability , balance,  and gait should be assessed in \nsurvivors with peripheral neuropathy and possibly in survivors with poor \nbone health before they engage  in exercise , and exercise choice should \nbe made based on the results (ie, stationary bike or water aerobics for \nsurvivors with poor balance).  In addition, balance training can be \nrecommended for patients at risk for  falls. Moderate -risk survivors can \noften follow the general recommendations for physical activity; however, medical clearance and/or referrals to trained personnel such as a physical \nor occupational therapist, certified exercise professional , or rehabilit ation \nspecialist can also be considered.

Neuropathic pain is caused by injury to the peripheral \nnervous system or CNS  and might be described as numbness or as \nburning, sharp,  tingling, prickling, electrical,  or shooting  pain. Neuropathic \npain often occurs as a side  effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or \nis caused by  surgical injury to the nerves.

Fatigue screening \ntools consist of a brief scale or survey. There \nis no exam or lab test for fatigue. Fatigue \nscreening helps identify people with fatigue and \nassess treatment results.\nFatigue ranges from mild to severe levels. Your \nprovider will perform an in-depth assessment \nif you have moderate or severe fatigue months \nafter initial treatment. An assessment is also \nneeded if fatigue starts or worsens after \ntreatment ends. \nYour provider will ask you questions. Be ready \nto describe when the fatigue started and \nwhether it\u2019s changed over time. Your provider \nwill also assess for causes of fatigue that can \nbe treated. Some health conditions that cause \nfatigue are listed in Guide 13 .\nYour provider will order blood tests if needed. \nA complete blood count (CBC) with differential \nmeasures parts of the blood, such as red blood \ncells. A comprehensive metabolic panel can \nshow if you have liver or kidney problems. \nLevels of hormones can be checked using a \nblood sample.\nSome people may need further testing. Your \nprovider may order imaging if you have \nconcerning symptoms. Imaging makes pictures \nof the insides of your body.

For instance, results of a \nrandomized controlled trial, in which 4282 wo men were randomly assigned \nto a Mediterranean diet with olive oil, a Mediterranean diet with mixed \nnuts, or a control low-fat diet, suggest that the olive oil/Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13 \u2013\n0.79).337 In the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI)  Dietary Modification trial , \nnearly 49,000 postmenopausal individuals  with a history of breast cancer  \nand with a dietary fat intake of \u226532% of energy were randomized 3:2 to  a \nusual diet group or a dietary intervention group .338 After an average follow -\nup of 8.1 years, 655 (0.42%) individuals  in the intervention group and 1072  \nindividuals (0.45%) in the comp arison group developed invasive breast \ncancer (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83 \u20131.01).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "055859cf-ee30-48fa-8224-740b3e8d36eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "055859cf-ee30-48fa-8224-740b3e8d36eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94bcf1c9-0627-4889-b72d-47b9062b2ce7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "55739b7235b2204d9df6fdc501ae29119d4b70e6999c0699b7d2cedc2331f1fb"}}, "hash": "55739b7235b2204d9df6fdc501ae29119d4b70e6999c0699b7d2cedc2331f1fb", "text": "Physical activity  Activity goals\nResistance training increases muscle strength. \nIt may include using weights, elastic bands, or \nyour own body weight to work your muscles. \n \u0086Do resistance training 2 to 3 times a week. \n \u0086Do stretching exercises on 2 of the days of \nhigher-intensity activity.\nContact a trained provider if you\u2019re new to \nresistance training.

If detected \nearly, treatment for a late effect may reduce its \nimpact on your life.\nCancer surveillance\nCancer that was thought to be cured can \nreappear on tests. The return of cancer is \ncalled a recurrence or relapse. Survivorship \ncare includes routine checking for a recurrence. \nThis is called surveillance. Surveillance often \nincludes updating your health history and a \nphysical exam. Some survivors get blood tests \nor imaging like x-rays or scans.\nScreening for cancer\nCancer screening is routine testing of cancer \nor pre-cancer conditions. The aim is to detect \ncancer at an early stage when treatment works \nbest. There is screening for prostate, breast, \ncervical, skin, lung, and colorectal cancers. \nScreening is started when there is an average \nor high risk of cancer. Ask your health care \nprovider what screening, if any, you need.\nSurvivors have a higher risk of a new (second) \ncancer. Ask your health care provider about \nyour chance of getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some causes of a first cancer may be \nrelated to getting a second cancer.\n \u0086Some cancer treatments may increase \ncancer risk. Such treatments include \nradiation therapy, certain chemotherapies, \nand certain targeted therapies. \u0086Excess radiation from a lifetime of \ncomputed tomography (CT) scans slightly \nincreases cancer risk. Ask your provider if \nthese scans are needed and for how long.\nSome survivors are at risk of hereditary \ncancers. Hereditary cancer is caused by \nabnormal genes that are passed down from \nparents to children. Cancers that can be \nhereditary include breast, ovarian, colorectal, \nand prostate cancer.\nAt health visits, update your health care \nproviders on any new cancers among your \nblood relatives. Your provider may suggest \ngetting genetic testing. A blood sample is \nneeded. You may talk with a genetic counselor \nto discuss your family\u2019s cancer history.\nLate effects\nMany effects of treatment quickly resolve \nafter treatment ends. An example is nausea \nand vomiting. Long-term effects start during \ntreatment and persist after treatment is done. \nLess often, effects start long after treatment \nhas ended. During health visits, your health \ncare providers will assess for such late effects. \nThey will provide treatment for late or long-term \neffects as needed.\nCoordinated care\nCancer survivors often receive care from \nmultiple providers. You may receive care from \noncologists, a primary care provider, and non-\ncancer specialists. Your providers will work \ntogether and clarify their roles to address all \nyour needs.

However , many cancer survivors report that fatigue may be a \ndisruptive symptom months or years after treatment ends.\n\u0017Fatigue that initially presents months after the completion of adjuvant therapy or fatigue that worsens over this period warrants additional \nevaluation.\n\u2022 Fatigue is a subjective experience that should be systematically assessed using patient self-reports and other sources of data for cancer \nsurvivors in the months and years after diagnosis.\n\u2022 Patients and family/caregiver(s) should be informed that management of fatigue is an integral part of total health care and that fatigue can \npersist following treatment.\n\u2022 Medical care contracts should include reimbursement for the management of fatigue.\n\u2022 Disability insurance should include coverage for the continuing effects of fatigue.\n\u2022  Referral to rehabilitation services including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and physical medicine should be considered for \nsurvivors with fatigue in the months and years after cancer diagnosis.\n\u2022 Also see the NCCN Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed817240-2059-40bc-8ca6-899c0e13393b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed817240-2059-40bc-8ca6-899c0e13393b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2463fdf-5fd7-416e-85c5-bb188157d4f4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "file_path": "/home/jp65/Survivorship_Care/data/surv_guidelines/survivorship_clinicians.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-10", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-02"}, "hash": "2fccf630fe938f4cdbe69406260214756393a32b6f05010019c4d534d4fca842"}}, "hash": "2fccf630fe938f4cdbe69406260214756393a32b6f05010019c4d534d4fca842", "text": ".\nSurvivorship: Sexual Health\n\n\n\n\na Sexual function and management of hormone-related symptoms are important aspects of quality of life for all cancer survivors.
