Additional Notes:
Michael Thompson was diagnosed with advanced-stage ALK-positive NSCLC following persistent cough and incidental findings on imaging. He underwent successful surgery with clear margins and completed a course of adjuvant chemoradiation. He is currently on Lorlatinib as part of his targeted therapy regimen and is tolerating treatment well with manageable side effects. His most recent scans showed no evidence of disease progression.

His care team includes a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals to support his treatment and address the physical, nutritional, and psychosocial aspects of his care. Michael is a retired engineer, non-smoker, and enjoys spending time with his grandchildren. He is actively involved in a lung cancer support group and has expressed a positive outlook on his treatment journey. Regular follow-ups are scheduled with his medical oncologist, Dr. Lisa Chang, to monitor his response to Lorlatinib and adjust his treatment plan as necessary. Michael's family is highly supportive and participates in his care decisions.

His current medications include Lorlatinib, atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia, and gabapentin for neuropathy. He is advised to maintain a balanced diet, engage in light physical activity as tolerated, and report any new symptoms to his care team immediately. His next evaluation is scheduled in three months, or sooner if needed.
