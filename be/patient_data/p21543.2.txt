**Additional Details**
Michael Thompson was initially treated with a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which was well-tolerated initially, but he developed progressive disease after 8 months of treatment. Due to the progression and after thorough discussions regarding treatment options and potential side effects, it was decided to proceed with second-line therapy using Docetaxel. Michael has been experiencing increased fatigue and has been referred to a dietician to manage weight loss and nutritional intake. He is also receiving supportive care for his neuropathy, which includes medication management and physical therapy.

Michael has been enrolled in a palliative care program to address symptom management and improve his quality of life. He has regular follow-ups with his medical oncologist to monitor his response to the ongoing treatment and adjust the care plan as needed. Michael's family is actively involved in his care, and they have been provided with resources to support them during this challenging time. Michael has expressed interest in exploring clinical trials and has been referred to a research coordinator for evaluation of eligibility for potential enrollment in upcoming trials.
