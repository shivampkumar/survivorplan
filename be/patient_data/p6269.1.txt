Additional Information:
Michael Thompson was diagnosed with advanced-stage IVC squamous NSCLC after presenting with persistent cough and unintentional weight loss. Imaging studies and a subsequent biopsy confirmed the diagnosis and revealed a PDL1 expression of 70%. Given the high PDL1 expression and the absence of actionable mutations, Michael was deemed an appropriate candidate for immunotherapy with pembrolizumab as the first-line treatment. He has tolerated the treatment well with manageable side effects and is currently under close surveillance with routine imaging to monitor for disease progression. He is a former smoker and has a family history of various cancers, which has been discussed with his medical oncologist regarding potential genetic counseling. His care team remains optimistic about the response to treatment and continues to support him through his journey with cancer. Michael is also involved in a lung cancer support group and has expressed interest in participating in clinical trials that his medical oncologist may recommend.
