**Additional Information**
Maria is a retired school teacher with a history of smoking, which she quit 10 years ago. She lives with her husband and has a strong family support system. Her recovery from surgery has been steady, and she is actively engaged in her follow-up care. Maria is scheduled for regular imaging studies, including CT scans every six months for the next two years to monitor for recurrence. Her KRAS G12C mutation status has been documented, and she has been informed about the potential for targeted therapy options in the future. She is also up to date with her vaccinations, including pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccines, as recommended for lung cancer survivors.

Maria's prognosis is cautiously optimistic, and her care team is focused on maintaining her quality of life while keeping vigilant for any signs of cancer recurrence. Her next follow-up appointment with her medical oncologist is set for 04/15/2023.
